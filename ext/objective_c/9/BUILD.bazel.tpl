# Bazel-native overlay for `package:objective_c` 9.x.
#
# Mirrors `hook/build.dart`:
#   * macOS+iOS only.
#   * Compiles every `.c`/`.m` under `src/` plus (macOS only)
#     `test/util.c` into a single shared library named `objective_c.dylib`,
#     installed under @rpath at runtime.
#   * Registers the library under the asset id
#     `package:objective_c/objective_c.dylib` so the kernel manifest the
#     frontend_server reads via `--native-assets` resolves
#     `DynamicLibrary.open("objective_c.dylib")` at runtime.
#
# Hand-curated translation of the package's `dart build hooks` output.
# Substitutions ({HUB_NAME}, {PKG}, {VERSION}) are injected by
# `flutter_pub_package`'s `_resolve_overlay`. We don't read {VERSION}
# here — the overlay sits under `9/`, so any 9.x version routes here.
