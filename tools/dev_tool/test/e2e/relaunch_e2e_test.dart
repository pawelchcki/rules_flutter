/// The control channel must survive the restart branch that relaunches the
/// app process.
///
/// A hot restart cannot replace a `dlopen`ed native library, so `app.restart`
/// rebuilds and — when the bundle's loose native libraries changed — kills the
/// running process and launches the rebuilt one. The run's session loop used
/// to read that deliberate kill as the app exiting, which closed the HTTP
/// control channel: the driver got `{"relaunched":true}` and then
/// connection-refused, with the relaunched app alive and no second banner to
/// find it by. Nothing short of driving a real native-library change exercises
/// that branch, which is why this test edits C source rather than Dart.
