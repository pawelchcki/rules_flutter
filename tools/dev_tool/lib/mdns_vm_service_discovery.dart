/// Out-of-band discovery of a Dart VM service over mDNS (Bonjour).
///
/// Every Flutter app built in debug or profile mode advertises its VM service
/// as `_dartVmService._tcp` on the local network, carrying the port in the SRV
/// record and the service auth code in the TXT record. On a physical iOS
/// device that advertisement is the *only* channel that reliably reports the
/// VM service: the announcement the engine prints to stdout does not reach a
/// pipe through `devicectl --console`, and `idevicesyslog` is gone on modern
/// Xcode. It is also the only channel that works at all for a wirelessly
/// attached device, where there is no USB transport to scrape.
///
/// This is deliberately *not* a second discovery mechanism racing the log
/// scrapers used by every other platform ([discoverVmServiceUri]). It is the
/// single mechanism for physical iOS devices, and no other platform uses it.
/// A device's records are told apart from the host's — a Mac running the same
/// app in a simulator advertises on the same network — by matching the SRV
/// target against the hostnames `devicectl` reports for that device.
///
/// On macOS the mDNS socket requires the Local Network privacy permission.
/// Denied, it fails as a `SocketException` rather than an empty result, which
/// is why [MdnsVmServiceDiscovery.discover] translates that into a specific,
/// actionable error instead of a generic timeout.
