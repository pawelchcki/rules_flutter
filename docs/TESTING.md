# Testing Guide

Complete instructions for testing rules_flutter changes. Run **all applicable sections** before considering work done.

> **Never run `bazel clean`** — it destroys the cache and causes long rebuilds.

## 1. Root workspace

```sh
bazel test //...
```

## 2. dev_tool tests

Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies):
```sh
cd tools/dev_tool && dart test --exclude-tags=e2e
```

E2e tests (spawn real builds, require platform toolchains — run sequentially):
```sh
cd tools/dev_tool && dart test test/e2e/ --tags=e2e --concurrency=1
```

### macOS permission prerequisites

Two e2e groups drive the OS, not just the app, and macOS gates both behind
permissions granted to **the terminal (or IDE) that launches the tests** —
neither can be granted programmatically. Grant them in
System Settings → Privacy & Security:

| Permission | Needed by | Symptom when missing |
|---|---|---|
| **Screen Recording** | `macos_e2e_test.dart` and `multi_window_e2e_test.dart` native-screenshot tests (ScreenCaptureKit) | Test **fails**: `Failed to start stream due to audio/video capture failure` / `No capturable windows for the target pid` |
| **Accessibility** | `agent_e2e_test.dart` occlusion test, which minimizes the app window to pause the embedder's vsync | Test **skips**: `could not minimize the window (no Accessibility permission?)` |

These dependencies are essential rather than incidental: there is no way to
capture a real window without Screen Recording, and no way to put the embedder
into its frames-paused state — the condition the occlusion regression is about
— without OS-level window control. Stubbing either would mean the test no
longer exercises the behaviour it exists to guard.

Note the asymmetry: a missing Screen Recording permission fails loudly, while a
missing Accessibility permission skips. A skip is easy to overlook in a long
run, so check for `~` in the summary line before treating the agent suite as
fully green.

### Dev tool e2e test matrix

| Test file | Platform | What it validates |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| `macos_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | `--screenshot` (VM service), `--machine` screenshot, `--quit-after-start` |
| `web_e2e_test.dart` | Any (needs Chrome) | WASM + JS `--screenshot` (CDP), `--machine` screenshot |
| `ios_simulator_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | `--screenshot` (simctl), `--machine` screenshot |
| `machine_protocol_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | Protocol lifecycle events, unknown-method error (reload/restart correctness is manual — see "Hot reload / hot restart (manual)") |
| `attach_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | Launch app externally → attach → VM service connects |
| `dart_defines_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | `--dart-define` reaches the app (comma-in-value intact) and survives a hot reload (frontend_server -D replay) |
| `agent_e2e_test.dart` | macOS | Full `app.*` agent surface (tap/enterText/getText/…), and that it still works **after `app.restart`** (engine-hook registrant re-registers extensions) |
| `plugin_example_e2e_test.dart` | macOS/iOS-sim/Android/Chrome | Plugin apps render non-blank frames; Dart plugin registration survives `app.restart` (macOS); web plugins register in both DDC and `--wasm` dev mode (Chrome) |

### Dev tool screenshot mechanisms

| Device | Debug mode (VM service) | Profile/release (no VM service) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| macOS | `_flutter.screenshot` via VM service | `screencapture -x` |
| Linux | `_flutter.screenshot` via VM service | `scrot` |
| Windows | `_flutter.screenshot` via VM service | PowerShell `CopyFromScreen` |
| Android | `_flutter.screenshot` via VM service | `adb screencap` |
| iOS Simulator | `simctl io screenshot` (always) | `simctl io screenshot` (always) |
| Chrome/Web | CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` (always) | N/A (web is always debug) |

Note: `_flutter.screenshot` captures only the Flutter widget tree (no OS chrome). OS-level tools capture the full screen/window.

## 3. E2E workspaces (automated)

Run `bazel test //...` in each workspace. All non-manual tests run automatically.

```sh
cd e2e/smoke && bazel test //...
cd e2e/hello_world && bazel test //...
cd e2e/codegen && bazel test //...
cd e2e/ffi_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/ffi_plugin_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/plugin_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/macos_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/ios_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/multi_window_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/android_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/web_example && bazel test //...
cd e2e/linux_example && bazel test //...    # Linux-only (target_compatible_with)
cd e2e/windows_example && bazel test //...  # Windows-only (target_compatible_with)
```

**Platform notes:**
- macOS-only targets (macos bundle tests, ios_example) are skipped on other platforms via `target_compatible_with`.
- Linux-only targets (linux bundle tests, linux_example) are skipped on macOS/Windows.
- Windows-only targets (windows_example) are skipped on macOS/Linux.
- `android_example` and `hello_world` (Android targets) require `ANDROID_HOME` to be set to the Android SDK path (e.g. `export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS) and `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to the NDK path (e.g. `export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/<version>`).
- Android workspaces whose plugins declare `<uses-permission>` in their library manifests (e.g. `record_android`'s RECORD_AUDIO) need `common --merge_android_manifest_permissions` in `.bazelrc`: Bazel's manifest merger strips library permissions by default, while AGP always merges them. The flag matters only for **plugin library** manifests — the app's own debug INTERNET permission comes from `flutter_android_app`'s variant-manifest merge (below) and needs no flag.
- `flutter_android_app` merges `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml` (where `flutter create` declares `android.permission.INTERNET`) into `-c dbg` APKs only, mirroring Gradle's variant merge. Debug APKs therefore host the Dart VM service out of the box; release APKs stay permission-free. `plugin_example`'s and `hello_world`'s flutter-create manifests are kept pristine to cover this path; `android_example` declares INTERNET in its hand-written `src/main` manifest and has no variant manifests, covering the no-op path. `verify_android_apk_test` in `plugin_example` is mode-aware: it asserts INTERNET present + `kernel_blob.bin` under `-c dbg`, and INTERNET absent + `libapp.so` in default (release) builds.
- Android builds need no platform flags: `flutter_android_bundle` transitions the application to the Android platform matching its `android_abi`, and packaging hard-fails on any non-ELF native library. `verify_android_apk_test` in `e2e/android_example` asserts every packaged `.so` is ELF with the ABI's machine type, and that every androidx class the engine needs at runtime (including the profileinstaller → concurrent-futures → listenablefuture chain) is defined in the APK's dex — so a missing runtime dep fails in CI without an emulator.
- If Xcode beta causes `local_config_xcode` errors, add `--repo_env=DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.
- `cross_compile_example` has no test targets; verify with `bazel build :cross_linux`.

### What the automated e2e tests cover

| Workspace | Key tests |
|-----------|-----------|
| smoke | Toolchain resolution for all platforms |
| hello_world | Kernel, AOT, application, and per-platform bundle builds; flutter_test |
| codegen | Per-file and aggregate dart_codegen, custom generators, hot-reload-with-codegen |
| ffi_example | Both FFI mechanisms — Native Assets (`add_plugin`, `@Native` asset-id bind) and `native_deps` (`mul_plugin`, conventional-path open) — bundle structure on macOS/Linux plus manual runtime proof on iOS simulator and macOS |
| ffi_plugin_example | FFI plugin build + macOS/Linux bundle structure with `libmultiply.dylib`/`.so` |
| plugin_example | Real pub.dev plugins (`path_provider`, `url_launcher`, `package_info_plus`) plus the hand-written `:greeting_plugin` regression case; per-platform bundle builds; Playwright web assertions; macOS runtime verifier asserting the four plugin-result strings. See **Plugin verification matrix** below. |
| macos_example | Full macOS app build + bundle structure verification (Info.plist, ObjC symbols, framework linkage, AOT dylib, flutter_assets) |
| ios_example | iOS app build (requires Xcode) |
| web_example | Web app builds (dart2wasm + dart2js) with web_assets |
| multi_window_example | Multi-window macOS + multi-scene iOS builds with FlutterEngineGroup; macOS bundle verification |
| android_example | Android APK build (3 approaches: flutter_android_app, Bazel-generated manifest, custom manifest) + APK content verification + web build |
| linux_example | Linux desktop app (2 approaches: flutter_linux_app, Bazel-generated runner) + bundle structure verification |
| windows_example | Windows desktop app (3 approaches: flutter_windows_app, Bazel-generated runner, custom cc_binary) + bundle structure verification |

### Plugin verification matrix

`e2e/plugin_example` exercises real pub.dev plugins — `path_provider` (federated, SwiftPM Apple, **jnigen Android** — path_provider_android ≥ 2.3 calls Java through `package:jni`, whose C support library `libdartjni.so` is built from source by the bundled `ext/jni` overlay and packaged at `lib/<abi>/` — pure-Dart Linux/Windows), `url_launcher` (federated, SwiftPM Apple, Kotlin Android, real C++ Linux/Windows, web Dart), `package_info_plus` (monolithic, every platform including web), `audio_session` (curated `ext/` overlay), and `record_android` 1.5.1 (Android-only federated implementation used without its umbrella — regression case for a plugin that ships `android/src/main/res/` resources referenced as `R.drawable.ic_mic` and declares **no** Gradle dependencies, compiling purely against the embedding's exported androidx classpath) — plus the hand-written `:greeting_plugin` (regression case for pure-Bazel-deps plugins). `lib/main.dart` resolves a string from each plugin and renders + emits them on a single `plugin_example_results …` log line. Each platform's e2e check asserts the line is correct; empty/null/error content fails loudly.

| Assertion | Source | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `appName=…` | `PackageInfo.fromPlatform()` | `Plugin Example` on macOS/iOS (from `CFBundleName` in the generated Info.plist), `plugin_example` on web (from the auto-generated `version.json`'s `app_name`). Failure means the `package_info_plus` registrant didn't fire on that platform. |
| `documentsPath=…` | `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory().path` (`kIsWeb`-guarded) | `/Users/…` on macOS, `/var/…` on iOS, `/home/…` on Linux, `C:\Users\…` on Windows, `/data/user/0/…` on Android, `web: not supported` on web. |
| `tempPath=…` | `getTemporaryDirectory().path` (`kIsWeb`-guarded) | Absolute path with the platform-appropriate prefix; web shows `web: not supported`. |
| `launchOk=launch ok` | `canLaunchUrl(Uri.parse('https://flutter.dev'))` | Exact `launch ok` on macOS/iOS/Linux/Windows/web. On Android the correct value is `launch denied`: `canLaunchUrl` is subject to package visibility and the app declares no `<queries>` for https VIEW intents (flutter create output ships untouched). Either way the channel responded — an `error:` value means the `url_launcher` registrant didn't fire. |
| `greeting=Hello from GreetingPlugin!` | `//greeting_plugin:greeting_plugin` (regression case) | Exact match. |
| `recordHasPermission=…` | `MethodChannel('com.llfbandit.record/messages')` `create` + `hasPermission(request: false)` | `has=true` on Android (`verify_android_app_test` grants RECORD_AUDIO via `adb shell pm grant` first, which itself fails if the plugin's manifest didn't merge); `not supported` everywhere else. An `error:` value means the `record_android` registrant didn't fire or its resources failed to compile. |

| Platform | Where the assertion runs |
|---|---|
| Web | `npx playwright test` in `e2e/plugin_example/playwright/web.spec.js` (asserts the four strings via captured console messages). |
| macOS | `:verify_macos_app_test` (manual stdout check) plus the `macOS e2e` group of `tools/dev_tool/test/e2e/plugin_example_e2e_test.dart` (runs `:plugin_macos`, captures a screenshot via the dev_tool's HTTP control channel, asserts the PNG is well-formed and non-blank). Run with `cd tools/dev_tool && dart test test/e2e/plugin_example_e2e_test.dart --tags=e2e --plain-name="macOS"`. |
| iOS Simulator | `iOS Simulator e2e` group of the same file. Boot any iOS simulator first (`xcrun simctl boot <udid>`), then run `dart test … --plain-name="iOS Simulator"`. |
| Android | `:android_bundle_build_test` (build), `:verify_android_apk_test` (APK content: `libdartjni.so` present + ELF/ABI-valid, jni support classes in dex — runs in `bazel test //...`), `:verify_android_app_test` (manual: install on emulator/device, RESUMED + crash-buffer fail-fast, asserts the `plugin_example_results` logcat line reports a real `/data/user/0/…` path from path_provider — proves jnigen plugin registration end to end), plus the `Android e2e` group. Pre-step: bring up a device — either USB-authorize a phone (`adb devices` shows `device`) or boot an emulator (`emulator -avd flutter_test &`). The test resolves the first authorized serial via `firstAndroidSerial()` and runs `:plugin_android` against it; both emulator and connected-device paths must pass. The dev_tool screenshot uses `_flutter.screenshot` for debug builds, falling back to `adb screencap`. |
| Linux | `:linux_bundle_build_test` (build only). Visual verification on the GCP VM is manual (see § Linux visual verification). |
| Windows | `:windows_bundle_build_test` (build only). Visual verification on the GCP VM is manual (see § Windows visual verification). |

The dev_tool screenshot is the dispositive end-to-end gate per platform: if Native Assets are broken the app crashes before drawing, and if plugin auto-wiring is broken `MissingPluginException` blanks the screen — both fail the non-blank PNG check (default threshold 4 KB, well above any blank/solid-color PNG).

### Android plugin native source builds (externalNativeBuild)

Some pub packages compile C/C++ for Android via Gradle's
`externalNativeBuild` (CMake/ndk-build) — e.g. `package:jni`, whose
`libdartjni.so` every jnigen-based plugin loads with
`System.loadLibrary("dartjni")`. rules_flutter has no generic translation
for arbitrary Gradle native builds; instead:

1. A curated overlay reproduces the build with `cc_library` +
   `cc_shared_library` (compiled by the registered NDK toolchain via the
   Android bundle's platform transition) and ships the `.so` through
   `flutter_plugin.native_deps` behind a
   `select({"@platforms//os:android": …})`. The library flows through the
   existing transitive native-libs pathway into the bundle's
   `native_libs.jar` at `lib/<abi>/`, subject to the same ELF/ABI machine
   validation as every other packaged library. `ext/jni/1/` is the
   canonical example (note `shared_lib_name` must yield the exact filename
   `System.loadLibrary` resolves).
2. Packages declaring `externalNativeBuild` that no overlay handles fail
   the Android build at load time with a message pointing at
   `flutter.plugin_overlays` — never a silently incomplete APK.
   Non-Android platforms are unaffected (the check lives in the spoke's
   `android/` sub-package, loaded only via the hub's Android aggregator).

### Native Assets overlay authoring

Pub packages that ship a `hooks/build.dart` Dart-Native-Assets build hook (e.g. `package:objective_c`) get translated to Bazel-native equivalents under `ext/<pkg>/<major>/BUILD.bazel.tpl`. The template is loaded by `flutter_pub_package` for any spoke whose package name + major version matches.

Template substitutions: `{HUB_NAME}` (the user's `flutter.pub(name = ...)`), `{PKG}` (the package name), `{VERSION}` (the resolved version).

Procedure:

1. Locate the package's hook source under `~/Library/Caches/bazel/_bazel_<user>/.../external/<hub>__<pkg>/hook/build.dart`. Read what it builds (file glob, link mode, target platforms, copts).
2. Reproduce the build with `cc_shared_library` + `objc_library` (Apple) / `cc_library` (other platforms). Set `shared_lib_name` to something *different* from the bundle filename — `flutter_native_asset` symlinks the cc output to `<bundle_filename>` in its own package, and matching names collide.
3. Wrap each per-platform output in `flutter_native_asset(name = "<pkg>_native_asset_<os>", asset_id = "package:<pkg>/<basename>", link_mode = "dynamic_loading_bundle", library = ":_<pkg>_dylib", bundle_filename = "<basename>", target_os = "<os>")`. Add a parallel target per supported OS, gated on `target_compatible_with`.
4. Hang a `flutter_plugin(name = "<pkg>", platforms = [], native_assets = select({...}))` over them. Even though the package is "pure Dart" from pub's perspective, the empty-`platforms` plugin shape is what carries the native-assets entry into `FlutterInfo` for the application's manifest.
5. Drop the template at `ext/<pkg>/<major>/BUILD.bazel.tpl`. The next `flutter pub get` + Bazel build picks it up automatically.

If the build fails at runtime with `Couldn't resolve native function "<symbol>"`, the most common cause is the `cc_shared_library`'s `install_name` not matching the asset id's basename — set `user_link_flags = ["-Wl,-install_name,@rpath/<basename>"]` on Apple targets. See `ext/objective_c/9/BUILD.bazel.tpl` for the canonical example.

## 4. Manual tests

These require a GUI environment and are skipped by `bazel test //...`.

### macOS runtime smoke test

Launches the app, polls for a window, and verifies dimensions > 100x100. Catches window sizing bugs (e.g. the 1x32 collapsed-window bug).

```sh
cd e2e/macos_example
bazel test :verify_macos_app_test --test_tag_filters= --strategy=TestRunner=standalone
```

**When to run:** After any change to macOS runner code (`flutter/private/runners/macos/`).

### FFI runtime tests (iOS simulator, macOS, Linux, Windows)

Behavioral verification that both native-library mechanisms work at runtime:
`add()` binds via `@Native` asset-id resolution (`flutter_native_asset` →
`--native-assets` kernel manifest), `mul()` raw-opens its conventional path
(`native_deps`). The app writes
`ffi_example_result add(3,4)=7 mul(3,4)=12` to its temp dir; the tests read
it back (via `simctl get_app_container` on iOS).

```sh
cd e2e/ffi_example
bazel test :verify_ios_simulator_test --test_tag_filters= --strategy=TestRunner=standalone
bazel test :verify_macos_runtime_test --test_tag_filters= --strategy=TestRunner=standalone
# Linux (headless boxes need Xvfb; XAUTHORITY must pass through):
xvfb-run -a env LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 \
  bazel test :verify_linux_runtime_test --test_tag_filters= \
    --strategy=TestRunner=standalone \
    --test_env=DISPLAY --test_env=XAUTHORITY --test_env=LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE
# Windows (needs a display adapter — on GCP create the VM with --enable-display-device):
bazel test :verify_windows_runtime_test --test_tag_filters= --strategy=TestRunner=standalone
```

**When to run:** After any change to native-assets manifest emission
(`flutter_native_assets.bzl`, `flutter_native_asset.bzl`), native-library
bundling (`flutter_ios_native_frameworks`, `flutter_macos_native_libs`), or
kernel compilation flags.

### macOS visual verification

Launches the app binary directly, captures stdout/stderr, takes a screenshot, and prints structured JSON output. The screenshot file can be opened for visual verification.

```sh
cd e2e/macos_example && bazel build :app
# Extract the app
mkdir -p /tmp/macos_app && unzip -oq bazel-bin/app.zip -d /tmp/macos_app
# Run the diagnostic
dart run ../../e2e/_macos_test/verify_macos_app.dart /tmp/macos_app/app.app "Flutter App"
```

### Hot reload / hot restart (manual)

**MANDATORY** (CLAUDE.md verification policy item 6) for any change to the
dev_tool reload paths: `tools/dev_tool/lib/run_command.dart`,
`vm_service_client.dart`, `hot_reload/**`, `session.dart`. There is
intentionally **no automated assertion** for reload correctness — a weak
`expect(result, isNotNull)` smoke test previously stayed green through two
real macOS regressions (the `app.started`-before-orchestrator race and a
disposed VM-service connection). The bar is "I have seen the new text render
in the macOS window."

Verify all three, with `--no-devtools` (see Known issues):

1. **Race**: send `app.hotReload` *immediately* on the `app.started` event
   (no delay). Must return a success message, not
   `{"error":"Hot reload is still starting up."}` or
   `{"error":"No frontend server available"}`.
2. **Hot reload**: edit `lib/main.dart` visible text → `app.hotReload` →
   screenshot shows the new text.
3. **Hot restart**: edit again → `app.restart` → screenshot shows the
   change. Hot restart re-runs `main()` (engine `runInView`), so it must also
   reflect a change made *inside `main()`* (e.g. a value computed there) that a
   hot reload deliberately does NOT — verify a `main()`-level edit too.
4. **Agent surface after restart**: after `app.restart`, `app.getText` must
   still succeed. The `ext.rules_flutter.*` extensions are registered by the
   generated plugin registrant the engine invokes before `main()` on every
   root-isolate launch; if this errors with `Unknown method`, the registrant
   trio (`--source` ×2 + `-Dflutter.dart_plugin_registrant`) is missing from
   the dev tool's frontend_server invocation.

**Source-assembled (codegen) apps** — also verify against `e2e/codegen :app_macos`.
This is the coverage for apps that mix hand-written + generated sources, including
**dependency packages** that do so:
- app package `codegen_e2e`: `lib/user.dart` + `:user_json` → `lib/user.g.dart`
  (a generated `part`);
- dep `dep_part`: a generated `part` (`lib/settings.dart` + `:settings_gen`);
- dep `dep_lib`: a generated **standalone imported library** (`lib/catalog.dart`
  imports `lib/catalog.g.dart`).

`lib/main.dart` renders a value from all three in `build()`, so regenerated output
is reload-observable. Verify:
- **Codegen reload (the real flow — edit a codegen INPUT)**: add a field to a model
  source (`lib/user.dart`, or `dep_lib/lib/catalog.dart`) → `app.hotReload` → the
  regenerated output renders. The dev tool runs `bazel build` of the
  flutter_application (`refreshGenerated`) to regenerate `*.g.dart`, then the normal
  diff invalidates the changed library by its `package:` URI.
- **Hot restart over codegen**: edit the `User(...)` in `main()` → `app.restart` →
  the change renders and all generated code (app + deps) still resolves.
- **Dependency source edit**: edit a dep's hand-written source (e.g.
  `dep_part/lib/settings.dart`) → reload → renders. This exercises the
  `PackageUriResolver`, which keys every first-party source (app **and** deps) by its
  `package:` URI from the build-emitted `sourcePackages` — a dep edit must NOT be
  keyed `file://` (it would be silently dropped).

> **Gotcha — editing a generator SCRIPT mid-session is unreliable.** Don't verify
> codegen reload by editing the `dart_codegen` *generator script* (e.g.
> `tools/*_generator.dart`) and reloading. Rapid edit→revert cycles of a generator

> reliable.

Requires a `local_path_override` for `rules_dart` in `e2e/codegen/MODULE.bazel`
until the new rules_dart (`generate_dev_package_config` + `source_packages`) ships
in a release.

**Watch mode (filesystem-watcher-driven reload).** Machine mode defaults the watcher
off; pass `--watch` to drive reloads from on-disk edits instead of explicit
`app.hotReload` commands. Edit `lib/main.dart` and a **dependency** source on disk →
the watcher debounces and reloads → the change renders. Automated guard:
`tools/dev_tool/test/e2e/watch_reload_e2e_test.dart` (`dart test --tags=e2e`) asserts
the rendered output changes after watcher-triggered app + dep edits.

**Release/AOT codegen run.** `bazel build //:app_macos -c opt` (release/AOT), launch
the extracted `.app`, and capture its window (e.g. the bundled
`//tools/macos_screenshot:screenshot --pid <pid>`): the generated output from the
app package + both dep packages must render. This verifies the release `.pkgsrcs`
assembly + gen_snapshot path co-locates and compiles all generated code at runtime —
distinct from the dev multi-root path, and from the `build_test`s which only compile.

Tests the full dev tool hot reload cycle: launch app, take screenshot, edit source, hot reload, take screenshot, verify the change rendered, revert source.

```sh
cd e2e/macos_example

# 1. Start the dev tool with --machine for structured JSON events on stdout
dart run ../../tools/dev_tool/bin/flutter_bazel.dart run \
  -t :app -d macos --machine &

# 2. Read stdout for the app.started event (contains appId) and
#    http_control_channel event on stderr (contains URI and token)

# 3. Take a screenshot
curl -s "http://[::1]:PORT/sessions/APPID/screenshot/flutter?token=TOKEN" \
  -o /tmp/before.png

# 4. Edit lib/main.dart (change visible text)

# 5. Hot reload
curl -s -X POST "http://[::1]:PORT/command?token=TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"method": "app.hotReload"}'

# 6. Take another screenshot (should show the changed text)
curl -s "http://[::1]:PORT/sessions/APPID/screenshot/flutter?token=TOKEN" \
  -o /tmp/after.png

# 7. Revert the source change and stop the dev tool
```

**When to run:** After any change to the dev tool, frontend server integration, or hot reload logic.

**Known issues:**
- `app.hotReload` may report "no changes detected" if the file watcher already auto-reloaded the change. This only happens when the file watcher is enabled (terminal mode default); `--machine` disables it by default.

**Note:** the dev tool now owns DDS (starts it on the app's raw VM service and routes both its own VM client and DevTools through it), so `_flutter.screenshot` works with DevTools enabled — `--no-devtools` is no longer required.

### Linux visual verification (GCP VM)

Cross-compile a Linux debug bundle from macOS, deploy to a GCP VM, and verify the Flutter UI renders.

```sh
# 1. Cross-compile (requires LLVM toolchain — use cross_compile_example)
cd e2e/cross_compile_example && bazel build :cross_linux

# 2. Create a Linux VM
dart run tools/vm/create_linux_vm.dart flutter-linux-test

# 3. Deploy and verify
dart run tools/vm/deploy_bundle.dart flutter-linux-test e2e/cross_compile_example/bazel-bin/cross_linux

# 4. Clean up
gcloud compute instances delete flutter-linux-test --quiet
```

**When to run:** After any change to Linux runner code, engine selection, or bundle assembly.

### Windows visual verification (GCP VM)

Build natively on a Windows VM, take a DXGI screenshot — fully automated over SSH (no RDP needed).

The create script sets up auto-logon via sysprep specialize, so an interactive console session exists at boot. PsExec launches apps in that session and `dxcam` captures DXGI screenshots.

```sh
# 1. Create a Windows VM (auto-logon, MSVC, Python, dxcam, PsExec)
dart run tools/vm/create_windows_vm.dart flutter-windows-test

# 2. Deploy bundle and verify (automated — screenshot downloads locally)
dart run tools/vm/deploy_bundle.dart flutter-windows-test <bundle_path> --windows

# 3. Clean up
gcloud compute instances delete flutter-windows-test --quiet
```

**Key details:**
- `--enable-display-device` is mandatory — provides virtual GPU for D3D
- GDI `CopyFromScreen` captures D3D/Flutter surfaces as **black** — must use DXGI (`dxcam`)
- Console resolution is 800x600
- Files are written to `C:\temp\` (shared), not user profile dirs

**When to run:** After any change to Windows runner code, engine selection, or bundle assembly.

## 5. Playwright web tests

Playwright tests verify Flutter web apps load and render in a headless browser. These live in `playwright/` subdirectories within e2e workspaces.

| Workspace | What it tests |
|-----------|---------------|
| hello_world | Engine initializes, renders, correct page title |
| web_example | Engine initializes, renders, correct page title |
| plugin_example | Engine initializes, renders, correct page title |
| android_example | Engine initializes, renders, correct page title |

```sh
# From the e2e workspace, after building the web target:
cd e2e/hello_world
npx playwright test

Shared config and helpers are in `e2e/_playwright/`.

## 6. Standalone diagnostic scripts

These are not Bazel tests — they're standalone Dart scripts for manual investigation.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `e2e/_macos_test/verify_macos_app.dart` | Launch macOS app, verify window, screenshot | `dart run <script> <app.app> [title]` |
| `e2e/_linux_test/verify_linux_bundle.dart` | Verify Linux bundle directory structure | `dart run <script> <bundle_dir> [native_libs...]` |
| `e2e/_linux_test/verify_linux_app.dart` | Launch Linux GTK app under Xvfb, verify window, screenshot | `dart run <script> <bundle_dir> [title]` |
| `e2e/_windows_test/verify_windows_bundle.dart` | Verify Windows bundle directory structure | `dart run <script> <bundle_dir> [native_libs...]` |
| `e2e/_windows_test/verify_windows_app.dart` | Launch Windows app, verify window via PowerShell | `dart run <script> <bundle_dir> [title]` |
| `e2e/_windows_test/dxgi_screenshot.py` | Launch app + DXGI screenshot (captures D3D/Flutter) | `python <script> <exe_path> <output.png> [wait_s]` |
| `e2e/_compare/compare_artifacts.dart` | Diff flutter build vs bazel build outputs | `dart run <script> <flutter_dir> <bazel_dir>` |

### App output forwarding (manual)

Unit tests cover the buffering, filtering and routing; they cannot prove that a
real device's output actually arrives. Each launch path has its own log source
(see README § Dev Tool → App output), so each one needs its own check. The bar
is **"I saw the app's own output in my terminal"**, not "the tests passed".

```sh
# macOS — the reference case. plugin_example prints `plugin_example_results …`
# from a FutureBuilder, i.e. well after the VM service comes up.
cd e2e/plugin_example
flutter_bazel run -t :plugin_macos -d macos
#  → expect the `plugin_example_results …` line, and output that keeps
#    flowing rather than stopping right after the VM-service line.

# Machine mode: app output must travel as app.log and stdout must stay pure.
flutter_bazel run -t :plugin_macos -d macos --machine \
  | tee /tmp/machine.log >/dev/null
grep -c '"event":"app.log"' /tmp/machine.log     # > 0
grep -vc '^\[{' /tmp/machine.log                 # 0 — no raw text on stdout
```

Then per platform: `-d chrome` (both DDC and `--wasm`), `-d ios-simulator`,
`-d ios` on attached hardware, and an Android device or emulator. On Android
also confirm a deliberately thrown Java exception shows up as
`E/AndroidRuntime` — the old adb-level `flutter:I *:S` filter silenced those
entirely, so their absence used to look like normal operation.

Finally, check the pipe-pressure case, which is what the forwarding rewrite
removes: run an app that prints continuously well past 64 KB and confirm it
neither stalls nor dies. An unread pipe is the failure mode that only shows up
under sustained logging.

### iOS hardware (manual)

The simulator and a physical device find the VM service by different mechanisms
(log stream vs mDNS advertisement), and a wired device and a wireless one differ
again in how that service is reached, so passing on one proves nothing about the
others. All three need checking whenever `IOSDevice` or
`mdns_vm_service_discovery.dart` changes.

```sh
cd e2e/ios_example   # needs device/BUILD.bazel — see device.example/

flutter_bazel run -t //:app -d ios-simulator   # log-stream discovery
flutter_bazel run -t //device:app -d ios       # mDNS + iproxy forward
```

For each: confirm the app renders, then press `r` (hot reload) and `R` (hot
restart) and confirm the change appears on screen. "The tool printed
`Reloaded`" is not the bar — the UI is.

For the wireless case, unplug the cable with the device paired for network
debugging (Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators > *Connect via network*) and
confirm `xcrun devicectl list devices` reports `transportType: localNetwork`
before running. A wireless launch must pass `--vm-service-host=0.0.0.0` and dial
the device's own address; a wired one must do neither. If the device has never
been used this way it will prompt for Local Network permission once — accept it,
then re-run.

Expect a physical-device launch to take around a minute: starting a debug build
under the JIT breakpoint is slow (~43 s from resume to the engine's first log on
an iPhone 12 Pro), and the mDNS query only resolves once the app is up. If it
runs out the full timeout, read the error — it names the advertisements it did
see and which host sent each, which distinguishes "the app never started" from
"that was the copy running in a simulator on this Mac."

The `/logs` control endpoint is exercised by
`tools/dev_tool/test/e2e/plugin_example_e2e_test.dart`; to check it by hand,
tail it, then poll `nextCursor` twice and confirm the pages neither overlap nor
gap.
