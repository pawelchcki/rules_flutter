This document states exactly which parts of a `rules_flutter` build are
hermetic, which parts are declared non-hermetic, and why. Everything below is
grounded in the rule implementations (`flutter/repositories.bzl`,
`flutter/extensions.bzl`, `flutter/private/flutter_actions.bzl`,
`flutter/defs.bzl`) and enforced by the e2e test suite.

"Hermetic" here means: the action's behavior is a pure function of its declared
Bazel inputs — no network access, no reads from undeclared host state, and no
writes to shared state (in particular, never to the external SDK repository).

## What is fully hermetic

### SDK provisioning

The Flutter SDK is provisioned once, at repository fetch time, and is immutable
afterwards:

- **Pinned and verified.** `flutter.toolchain(flutter_version = "...")`
  downloads the official release archive with Bazel's integrity checking
  against the hashes recorded in `flutter/private/versions.bzl`.
- **Fetch-time launcher patch.** Stock Flutter's launcher rewrites
  `bin/cache/engine.stamp` and `bin/cache/engine.realm` on *every* invocation.
  At fetch time, `rules_flutter` patches
  `bin/internal/update_engine_version.sh` so those files are only written when
  their content is actually wrong — which never happens for a sealed,
  version-pinned SDK. If a Flutter release changes this script's content so
  the patch no longer applies, the fetch fails loudly rather than shipping a
  mutating launcher. (If a release removes the script entirely, the patch is
  skipped; the sealed cache below still catches any resulting write at build
  time.)
- **Optional precache, also at fetch time.** `precache = ["web", "android",
  ...]` verifies sentinel paths under `bin/cache` and, only when an artifact
  group is genuinely missing from the archive, runs `flutter precache` during
  the repository fetch (where network access is normal for Bazel). SDK
  repositories for platforms other than the host skip the precache step and
  print a warning instead; builds needing those artifacts fail later. One
  caveat: precached artifacts are engine-revision-pinned but not
  integrity-checked the way the archive itself is.
- **Sealed read-only.** As the last step of the fetch, `bin/cache` is made
  read-only (`chmod -R a-w`), so any residual write attempt fails the build
  loudly instead of silently mutating shared state. (The chmod-based seal is
  skipped on Windows hosts.)
- **Actions never need to write there.** The `flutter` build and test
  invocations export `FLUTTER_ALREADY_LOCKED=true` (skips the
  `bin/cache/lockfile` file-lock), pass `--no-version-check` and
  `--suppress-analytics`, set `FLUTTER_SUPPRESS_ANALYTICS=true` and `CI=true`,
  and run with a scratch `HOME` (`mktemp -d`; tests use
  `$TEST_TMPDIR/flutter_home`) so Flutter's config and analytics writes land
  in action-local scratch space, never in the SDK repository or your real
  home directory. Other actions and the developer-loop run helpers rely on
  the fetch-time launcher patch plus the sealed (read-only) cache instead:
  any residual write attempt fails loudly, which is the enforced backstop.

### Pub dependencies: no network at build time

Hosted packages are fetched as individual Bazel repositories by the `pub`
module extension, which reads the `pubspec.lock` files declared through
`pub.lock` and turns each into a hub repository carrying that lock's whole
hosted closure. Network
access happens only at repository fetch time. At build time, the
`FlutterPrepareDeps` action assembles a per-target pub cache purely by copying:
it merges the pub caches propagated by dependency targets into a fresh
`hosted/pub.dev/<name>-<version>` layout. It then writes
`.dart_tool/package_config.json` directly from the declared `pubspec.lock`
metadata, and stages the checked-in lock itself into the prepared workspace so
build_runner reads a genuine, pub-authored lock.
Downstream build and test actions regenerate `package_config.json` (plus the
`package_graph.json` newer flutter_tools require) from the same metadata with
sandbox-correct paths. No `pub get` runs and no resolver touches the network
anywhere on this path.

`pubspec.lock` is maintained by the generated run helper — `bazel run
//your/pkg:app_lib.update`, then `bazel mod tidy` — which is the *only* place
networked dependency resolution happens. (Mobile builds later re-run an
offline solve against the assembled cache — see the table below — but never
touch the network for pub.)

### Code generation

Both one-shot `generator_commands` and action-backed `build_runner build`
(`build_runner_modes = ["build"]`) run inside the hermetic
`FlutterPrepareDeps` action. The generator's entrypoint
(`bin/<executable>.dart`) is resolved from `package_config.json` and invoked as
`dart --packages=... <entrypoint>` deliberately instead of `dart run`: `dart
run` first checks that the package resolution is up to date and would attempt
an implicit — networked — `pub get`, which must never happen inside a build
action. `--delete-conflicting-outputs` is appended to `build_runner build` by
default.

`dart_proto_library` is hermetic for the same reason: the protoc plugin
executes out of its own pub repository, whose fetch vendored the exact
dependency closure pinned by its `pubspec.lock`, with a package config
generated at runtime from that metadata.

### Web builds

`{name}.web` runs `flutter build web --no-pub` under Bazel's default
sandboxing with no special execution requirements. Inside the action,
`package_config.json` is regenerated from `pubspec.lock` with sandbox-correct
paths — again without invoking pub — and the sealed SDK plus the assembled pub
cache are the only toolchain state the build sees. The action performs no
network access — by construction (no step on this path is networked) rather
than enforced by a network-blocking execution requirement.

### Tests, analysis, and formatting

`flutter_test` and `flutter_analyze_test` run from a prepared workspace;
`dart_format_test` does not need one:

- For the first two, the prepared workspace, pub cache, and `.dart_tool` tree
  are copied into `$TEST_TMPDIR`, `package_config.json` is regenerated from
  `pubspec.lock`, and `HOME` is set to `$TEST_TMPDIR/flutter_home`.
  `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` are explicitly cleared.
- `flutter_test` runs `flutter test --no-pub`; `flutter_analyze_test` runs
  `flutter analyze --no-pub`.
- `dart_format_test` runs the SDK's `dart format --output=none
  --set-exit-if-changed` directly against the runfiles copies of your sources.

None of these paths perform pub resolution or network access.

## The engine-framework exception

Sealing leaves exactly one carve-out: directories matching
`bin/cache/artifacts/engine/ios*` and `bin/cache/artifacts/engine/darwin*`
keep owner-write permission.

The reason is mechanical, not a hole in the guarantee: `flutter build ios`
copies the engine frameworks into the app's build directory with permissions
preserved, then codesigns *the copies* in place. If the source frameworks were
read-only, the permissions-preserved copies would be read-only too, and
codesigning them would fail. The Flutter tool never writes those framework
files in place inside the SDK — it only needs the copies to be writable — so
the no-mutation guarantee is unaffected. The rest of `bin/cache`, including
`lockfile` and the engine stamps, remains read-only, and the sealed-cache e2e
test (below) probes exactly that.

## Declared non-hermeticity, per target

Android and iOS builds are **declared non-hermetic** and carry explicit
execution requirements so Bazel schedules them accordingly. The exact tags set
in `flutter_actions.bzl`:

- `FlutterBuildAndroid` (apk/appbundle): `no-remote-cache`, `no-remote-exec`,
  `no-sandbox`, `requires-network`, plus `use_default_shell_env = True`.
  Under `--//flutter:android_gradle_offline` (see
  [Android: offline Gradle](#android-offline-gradle)) `requires-network` and
  `use_default_shell_env` both drop; the other two do not.
- `FlutterBuildIos`: `no-remote-cache`, `no-remote-exec`, `no-sandbox`,
  `requires-darwin`, `requires-network`, plus `use_default_shell_env = True`.

  `no-remote-cache` follows from the rest of the row: an action that reads the
  host toolchain and the network has inputs Bazel cannot see, so its key does
  not identify its output and the result is not safe to share with another
  machine. See [Remote execution](#remote-execution).
- Everything else (`FlutterBuild` for web and desktop targets,
  `FlutterPrepareDeps`, `SetupFlutterWorkspace`, tests): no special execution
  requirements; they run under Bazel's default sandboxing.

| Target | What's hermetic | What's not | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `{name}.web` | Everything: sealed SDK, assembled pub cache, `--no-pub` build, package config regenerated in-action. | Nothing declared. | No host tools or network are needed for web output. |
| `{name}.apk` / `{name}.appbundle` | The Flutter SDK, all Dart dependencies (the plugin-registrant regeneration runs `flutter pub get --offline` against a *mutable copy* of the assembled cache — pub writes bookkeeping such as `active_roots` into `PUB_CACHE`, so the read-only input is copied first; still no network for pub), `dart_defines`/`build_args`, `JAVA_HOME` from Bazel's java runtime toolchain. | Gradle downloads its distribution and Maven dependencies (`requires-network`); the Android SDK is the host installation consumed through rules_android's `@androidsdk//:sdk_path` (discovered via `ANDROID_HOME`); the action runs `no-sandbox`, `no-remote-exec`, with the client shell environment. | rules_android wraps the host SDK in a symlink tree that omits directories AGP 8 needs (`ndk/<version>`, `licenses/`), so the action resolves the *real* host SDK behind the wrapper — a tree that cannot be staged into a sandbox. Gradle has no offline story for a cold `GRADLE_USER_HOME`. |
| `{name}.ios` | The Flutter SDK, all Dart dependencies (same offline `pub get` against a mutable cache copy), `dart_defines`/`build_args`. | Host Xcode (`xcodebuild`) and CocoaPods are declared prerequisites; `pod install` (driven by the Flutter tool) fetches pod specs and binary pods over the network; the action runs `requires-darwin`, `no-sandbox`, `no-remote-exec`, with the client shell environment. Under `--incompatible_strict_action_env` the action probes common CocoaPods install locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.gem/bin`, ruby gem bindirs) before failing. | Relying on host Xcode is standard practice for Bazel Apple builds; CocoaPods manages its own spec repo and caches under `HOME`. |
| `flutter_test` / `flutter_analyze_test` / `dart_format_test` | Everything: the first two copy the prepared workspace and pub cache into `$TEST_TMPDIR` with a scratch `HOME` and `--no-pub`; `dart_format_test` runs `dart format` directly over the runfiles copies of its `srcs`. No network in any of them. | Nothing declared. | Tests only consume already-prepared inputs. |
| `{name}.dev`, `{name}.update`, `build_runner` run helpers | The Flutter SDK they invoke (sealed and pinned; the `flutter`-driven `.dev`/`.update` helpers additionally set `FLUTTER_ALREADY_LOCKED` + `--no-version-check`, while the build_runner helpers invoke `dart` directly and rely on the seal). | These are `bazel run` helpers that operate on your **source** workspace by design: the dev server serves your live sources, and `.update` re-resolves dependencies (the whole point). `.update` works in a temporary copy of the workspace and writes back only `pubspec.lock`. | Developer-loop tooling, intentionally outside the build graph. |

Desktop targets (`macos`, `linux`, `windows`) run with the default sandboxed
configuration and no declared exceptions, but they depend on host platform
toolchains that Flutter discovers itself; they are not yet part of the
verified contract above.

## Cache opt-ins

The non-hermetic actions can reuse persistent host caches so warm builds skip
the network. Each opt-in is an environment variable. The mobile actions run
with the default shell environment, so without
`--incompatible_strict_action_env` a variable exported in your shell reaches
them directly; forwarding it with `--action_env=VAR` is the explicit,
recommended wiring, and is required once `--incompatible_strict_action_env`
is enabled.

### Android: persistent Gradle home

By default `GRADLE_USER_HOME` points into action-local scratch space, so every
cold build re-downloads the Gradle distribution and Maven dependencies. Opt
into persistence in `.bazelrc`:

```
build --//flutter:gradle_user_home=/home/me/.cache/rules_flutter_gradle
build --sandbox_writable_path=/home/me/.cache/rules_flutter_gradle
```

The Android action itself runs `no-sandbox`, so the `--sandbox_writable_path`
line is there to keep the directory usable if you tighten sandboxing later; it
is harmless otherwise. Gradle daemons are disabled inside the action
(`-Dorg.gradle.daemon=false`).

This used to be `--action_env=RULES_FLUTTER_GRADLE_USER_HOME`, which forced the
action to inherit the client shell environment in order to receive it. As a
build setting it is part of the action key instead, which is what lets the
offline path below drop `use_default_shell_env`.

### Android: offline Gradle

Gradle's dependencies can be made declared inputs rather than mid-action
downloads. Vendor the Maven closure into a `file://` mirror, point the build at
it with an init script, and set:

```
build --//flutter:android_gradle_offline
```

on a `flutter_app` that declares:

```starlark
flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    apk = {
        "android_sdk": "@androidsdk//:sdk_path",
        "android_maven_repo": "//android:maven_mirror",
        "android_gradle_init_script": "//android:gradle/init.d/hermetic.init.gradle.kts",
        "android_gradle_distribution": "//android:gradle-8.14.4-all.zip",
    },
    ...
)
```

The attributes alone change nothing; the flag is what turns the environment on,
so a consumer can declare them, keep building as before, and flip the flag once
the mirror is actually complete. With it on, the action:

- copies the init script into `GRADLE_USER_HOME/init.d/`,
- exports `RULES_FLUTTER_MAVEN_MIRROR` at the vendored repository,
- pre-extracts the distribution into `wrapper/dists/<name>/<hash>/` with the
  wrapper's `.ok` sentinel, deriving `<hash>` the way the wrapper does (MD5 of
  the `distributionUrl` in your `gradle-wrapper.properties`, read as an unsigned
  BigInteger in base 36) so the wrapper finds it instead of downloading,
- points `ANDROID_USER_HOME` at scratch so aapt2 and lint stop consulting
  `~/.android`,
- drops `requires-network` and stops inheriting the client shell environment.

Note the last one has teeth: with `use_default_shell_env` off the action gets
Bazel's minimal `PATH`, not yours. `JAVA_HOME` is still set explicitly from the
java runtime toolchain and the action's own helpers (`unzip`, `python3`) live in
the standard directories, but anything else your Gradle build shells out to is
now missing. A Flutter plugin that compiles Rust in a `preBuild` task fails with:

```
Execution failed for task ':my_plugin:buildRustArm64'.
> A problem occurred starting process 'command 'cargo''
```

**`--action_env=PATH` does not fix this.** `--action_env` populates the *default*
shell environment, and the whole point of this path is that the action no longer
uses it. The options are to put the directory in the target's own `env`
attribute, which is part of the action key and therefore honest about the
dependency, or to declare the tool properly as an input.

This is the flag working, not a defect: an action that silently reads whatever
happens to be on the developer's `PATH` is exactly the undeclared input it exists
to surface.

**Why an init script and not `dependencyResolutionManagement`.** It is the only
hook that reaches everything: the Flutter SDK's gradle directory arrives via
`includeBuild`, so it is a composite build with its own settings file, and each
pub-cache plugin declares its own `buildscript { repositories { ... } }` that
settings-level configuration cannot touch. `FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS` is not an
option either — `FlutterPlugin` unconditionally adds the engine repository as a
project repository after settings evaluation. A script hooked on
`RepositoryHandler.all {}` from `beforeSettings` and `allprojects` covers all of
it.

**What this does not buy.** `no-sandbox` and `no-remote-cache` stay. The Android
SDK still reaches the action as a *path* resolved through rules_android's
symlink wrapper to a host installation that is not an input at all, so the action
key still fails to describe the result and sharing it between machines would
still be wrong. Lifting those needs a declared, symlink-free SDK — a separate
piece of work.

### iOS: persistent CocoaPods caches

`flutter build ios` keeps the caller's `HOME` when the build passes it
through, so CocoaPods' spec repo and pod caches persist across builds:

```
build --action_env=HOME
```

Under `--incompatible_strict_action_env`, `HOME` is absent from the action
environment; the action then falls back to a scratch `HOME` rather than
aborting (correct, but every build re-fetches pod specs). To relocate
CocoaPods' home directory explicitly, set `CP_HOME_DIR` via the dedicated
variable:

```
build --action_env=RULES_FLUTTER_CP_HOME=/home/me/.cache/rules_flutter_cocoapods
```

The action creates the directory and exports it as `CP_HOME_DIR` before the
Flutter tool drives `pod install`.

### build_runner: persistent incremental state

The dependency-preparation action runs `build_runner build` from a fresh
workspace each time, so by default every source edit re-runs codegen cold.
Point `//flutter:build_runner_cache` at an absolute directory to persist
build_runner's incremental `.dart_tool/build` state across builds:

```
build --//flutter:build_runner_cache=/home/me/.cache/rules_flutter_build_runner
build --sandbox_writable_path=/home/me/.cache/rules_flutter_build_runner
```

The action restores the cache before build_runner and saves it after, keyed
by target label + Flutter version + `pubspec.lock` digest, under a portable
lock. Every step is best-effort: an unwritable cache directory, a lost lock,
or a failed copy all degrade to a cold build_runner run (a failed copy
removes its partial destination, so a torn tree is never reused), and
correctness then rests on build_runner's own content-digest invalidation —
the same mechanism `build_runner watch` relies on. Measured on a large app, a
single-file edit's preparation action dropped from ~68s to ~55s, and the
saving grows the more codegen a change would otherwise redo.

Unlike the hermetic default, this opt-in makes the preparation action inherit
the client shell environment (so the cache directory is reachable), a
documented, opt-in reduction in hermeticity of the same kind as the
Gradle/CocoaPods caches above. Leave the flag empty (the default) for fully
hermetic, byte-identical builds.

## Remote execution

Hermetic is not the same as remote-executor-friendly. The dependency
preparation/codegen action and the web/desktop `flutter build` actions run
multi-process Dart tooling that needs several CPUs and real memory; on
default-size remote executors they can be dramatically slower than on the
local machine (a preparation step that takes about a minute on an 8-CPU
worker has been observed taking 50+ minutes remotely).

The rules therefore default these actions — and the `flutter_test` /
`flutter_analyze_test` / `dart_format_test` runners — to
**local execution** (`no-remote-exec`), with the *remote-cache* treatment
split by output shape:

- Small, expensive, high-value results stay **remotely cached**: staged pub
  packages, web/desktop `flutter build` outputs, `dart_proto_library`
  compiles, golden renders (`flutter_goldens`), and test results.
- The **large tree artifacts** — the assembled pub cache (multi-GB), the
  prepared workspace + `.dart_tool` (invalidated by every source edit), the
  workspace seed, and the per-target overlay workspaces — additionally carry
  `no-remote-cache`. Uploading them via `--remote_upload_local_results` on
  every change has been observed draining a CI invocation for minutes after
  the last test finished, while rebuilding them locally takes seconds; they
  remain eligible for the local disk cache (`--disk_cache`). Opt the trees
  back into the remote cache — e.g. when a warm main-branch runner populates
  a cache that ephemeral PR runners read — with:

  ```
  build --//flutter:remote_cache_trees
  ```

Android and iOS builds are `no-sandbox`/`requires-network` (see the per-target
table above), so the split above does not apply to them: they carry
`no-remote-cache` **unconditionally**, and neither
`//flutter:remote_cache_trees` nor `//flutter:allow_remote_execution` lifts
it. Their result depends on the host Gradle/Xcode toolchains, the Gradle user
home, and whatever the network serves — none of which is an action input, so
the action key does not describe the output. Sharing those results across
machines would hand one host's build to another under a key that claims they
are the same.

The same reasoning applies to `//flutter:build_runner_cache`: pointing it at
an absolute host directory makes the preparation action read state from
outside its inputs, so that action drops to `no-remote-cache`/`no-remote-exec`
regardless of the other flags. The default (empty) leaves it fully shareable.

On a well-resourced RBE fleet you can opt back into remote execution:

```
build --//flutter:allow_remote_execution
```

Under `allow_remote_execution` the tree posture is moot — remotely executed
actions must store their outputs in the remote CAS, so `remote_cache_trees`
is ignored there.

The flag is opt-in and **unverified against a real RBE fleet**. See
[remote-execution.md](remote-execution.md) for what has been audited, what
cannot work remotely at all (android, ios, `build_runner_cache`), and what to
check if you try it.

Executor sizing is intentionally left to you: pass your vendor's sizing
through target-level `exec_properties` or platform properties (for example
BuildBuddy's `EstimatedCPU`/`EstimatedMemory`). Locally, the actions declare
a `resource_set` of several CPUs so Bazel's scheduler does not oversubscribe
the machine.

## CI caching: making no-change runs near-instant

The prepare/assemble/codegen actions and the test rules are deterministic and
remote-cacheable by default, so a rebuild with no source changes is all cache
hits (seconds), not a re-run. Getting that on CI depends on the *consumer's*
configuration:

- **Persist a cache across runs.** The heavy work (SDK provisioning, pub-cache
  assembly, codegen) is cacheable, but a repository fetch is not an action — a
  fresh/ephemeral runner re-downloads and re-extracts the SDK and re-resolves
  every pub repository unless you persist a `--repository_cache` on a durable
  volume (or bake the pinned SDK + assembled pub cache into a warm runner image).
  Pair it with a remote cache (`--remote_cache` + `--remote_upload_local_results`)
  so the locally-executed `no-remote-exec` action results populate it.
- **Do not put volatile values in the action environment.** `--action_env=HOME`
  (or any volatile `--action_env`/`--repo_env`) becomes part of *every* action's
  cache key, so runners (or a developer vs. CI) with a different `HOME` cannot
  share cache entries — verified: changing `HOME` re-runs the prepared-workspace
  actions. The hermetic actions set their own scratch `HOME`, so they do not need
  it; scope `--action_env=HOME` to the iOS config that actually wants it (for
  CocoaPods cache persistence) rather than applying it globally.
- **Keep regeneration off the verify path.** If a "lint" job regenerates sources
  in place (protobufs, `build_runner`/`intl_utils` output, formatting, goldens)
  and commits them, run that as a *separate* step from `bazel test`: those
  writes mutate the package sources, which invalidates the prepared-workspace
  cache and forces a full codegen + test re-run even when nothing else changed.
  A pure `bazel test` verify step stays cache-hittable; the hermetic build does
  its own codegen, so it does not need the in-tree regenerated copies.

## Troubleshooting

### Seeing what an action actually ran

Bazel hides action output on success. To diagnose a failing or suspicious
Flutter action:

- `--verbose_failures` prints the full failing command line and its stderr.
- `--subcommands` (or `-s`) prints every command Bazel runs, including the
  generated action script.
- `--sandbox_debug` leaves the sandbox tree in place and prints its path so you
  can inspect the exact inputs the action saw.

The dependency-preparation/codegen action tees its `flutter pub get` and
generator output to a `<target>_pub_prepare.log` file next to the target's
other outputs under `bazel-bin/`, so after a build you can read, e.g.,
`bazel-bin/my_app/lib_pub_prepare.log` to see what pub resolution and code
generation printed.

### Common failures

- **"no Flutter toolchain is registered"** — no toolchain was resolved. Add the
  `flutter` extension and `register_toolchains("@flutter_toolchains//:all")`
  (see the README "Register a Flutter toolchain" section).
- **"Flutter `<v>` is not in the built-in version table"** — the pinned
  `flutter_version` is not in `versions.bzl`. Run
  `bazel run //tools:update_flutter_versions`, or supply an `integrity` map for
  the version (README "Using a version not in the built-in table").
- **SDK download integrity mismatch** — the pinned version's recorded hash does
  not match the fetched archive (a stale table entry, a version that was never
  published for that platform, or a wrong hand-supplied `integrity`). Confirm
  the archive exists at the printed URL and regenerate/verify its hash.
- **A `pubspec.lock` is stale or a hosted package is missing** — after editing
  a `pubspec.yaml`, run `bazel run //my_app:lib.update` to refresh the pinned
  dependency report, then `bazel mod tidy` to update `use_repo`. A brand-new
  manifest additionally needs a `pub.deps_manifest` entry in `MODULE.bazel`.
- **A write into `bin/cache` failed the build** — something invoked
  `flutter precache`/`flutter config` (or otherwise wrote into the SDK). The
  cache is sealed read-only on purpose; remove that step (see "The guarantee").
- **An action is dramatically slower on a remote executor** (minutes → tens of
  minutes) — the heavy Flutter actions default to local execution with remote
  caching. This is expected; see the "Remote execution" section to opt back in
  on a well-resourced fleet.
- **Embedding a generated pub-package target fails at analysis** — targets
  generated with `assemble_dep_caches = False` carry only their own payload and
  cannot be embedded; embed a `flutter_library`/`dart_library` that assembles
  its full cache (the default) instead.
- **`build_runner` output looks stale with the incremental cache enabled** —
  the opt-in cache (`RULES_FLUTTER_BUILD_RUNNER_CACHE`) is keyed by label + SDK
  version + `lock` digest and degrades to a clean rebuild on mismatch, so a
  stale result is unexpected; clear the cache directory to force a rebuild and
  file an issue.

## The guarantee

**No build action and no run helper writes to the external Flutter SDK
repository.** The launcher is patched at fetch time, the `flutter` build and
test invocations run with `FLUTTER_ALREADY_LOCKED` and `--no-version-check`
under a scratch or test-local `HOME`, and `bin/cache` is sealed read-only —
so even on the paths that skip some of those measures (direct `dart`
invocations, developer-loop helpers running under your real `HOME`), a
violation cannot be silent: any residual write attempt fails the offending
action.

This is enforced continuously by the e2e workspace:
`e2e/smoke/sdk_cache_sealed_test.sh` (target
`//:sdk_cache_sealed_test` in `e2e/smoke`) resolves the real SDK path behind
the runfiles symlinks, attempts to create a file inside `bin/cache`, and
asserts both that the write fails and that `bin/cache/lockfile` is not
writable. Do not run `flutter precache` or `flutter config` against the
Bazel-provided SDK from your own scripts: it is unnecessary, and the sealed
cache will reject it.
