/// Runtime verification: launches the macOS .app and checks window dimensions.
///
/// This test requires a GUI environment and accessibility permissions, so it
/// uses `tags = ["manual"]` to skip during normal `bazel test //...` runs.
/// Run explicitly: `bazel test :verify_macos_app_test --test_tag_filters=`
///
/// Everything is addressed by the PID this test launched, never by the bundle
/// name. Naming the process instead let a leftover "Flutter App" — one an
/// earlier run failed to reap, or a copy the developer launched by hand —
/// answer for the bundle under test: the window count came back positive, the
/// size was plausible, and the test passed without the freshly built binary
/// ever having drawn anything. Launching `Contents/MacOS/<exe>` directly
/// rather than through `open` is part of that: LaunchServices would activate
/// an already-running instance of the same bundle id instead of starting ours.
///
/// Pass criteria:
/// - App launches without crashing
/// - Window appears within 30s
/// - Window width > 100 AND height > 100 (catches the 1x32 sizing bug)
