"""Toolchain-backed MaterialIcons font target.

`@rules_flutter//flutter:material_icons` is a regular FlutterInfo provider
target — same shape as any pub-spoke `flutter_library` shipping a font —
backed by the active flutter toolchain's MaterialIcons-Regular.otf file.

Apps that use Material widgets opt in by listing this label in their
`flutter_application(deps = [...])`. The asset-bundle aggregator walks
transitive `FlutterInfo.pub_fonts` and bundles MaterialIcons via the same
code path it uses for cupertino_icons or any other pub package's font —
no special case in `flutter_build_assets`.

The `package_name = ""` sentinel on the contribution tells the aggregator
to bundle the font at bare `fonts/MaterialIcons-Regular.otf` and to write
FontManifest family `MaterialIcons` (no `packages/<pkg>/` prefix). This
matches Flutter's built-in MaterialIcons widget, which references the
font via `fontFamily: "MaterialIcons"` with no `fontPackage` — so
const_finder's tree-shaking key shape is preserved.

A single small custom rule (rather than a `flutter_library` macro) avoids
selecting the platform-specific toolchain repo at the call site: the rule
discovers the font File via `ctx.toolchains[...]` instead.
