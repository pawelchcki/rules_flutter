"""Flutter Android application bundling.

Produces the native artifacts needed for an Android APK:
- A .jar containing lib/arm64-v8a/libapp.so (AOT-compiled Dart code)
- flutter_assets/ tree artifact

The user wires these outputs into rules_android's android_binary:

    load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_bundle")

    flutter_application(
        name = "my_app_flutter",
        main = "main.dart",
    )

    flutter_android_bundle(
        name = "my_app_android",
        application = ":my_app_flutter",
    )

    # Wire into android_binary via java_import:
    java_import(
        name = "my_app_native",
        jars = [":my_app_android_native_libs.jar"],
    )

    android_binary(
        name = "my_app",
        manifest = "AndroidManifest.xml",
        deps = [":my_app_native", "@flutter_android_engine_arm64//:flutter_embedding"],
        ...
    )

The native_libs.jar packages libapp.so at lib/<abi>/libapp.so inside a jar,
matching the same convention as flutter.jar (which packages libflutter.so).
This lets android_binary extract and package the .so into the APK automatically.

flutter_android_bundle applies a platform transition derived from its
`android_abi` attribute, so the application — including its AOT compile and
any FFI/native deps — always builds for the matching Android platform
(//flutter/platforms:android_arm64 or :android_x64) with no --platforms
flag from the user. Every native library is validated to be an ELF shared
object with the ABI's machine type before packaging; a host-format binary
is a hard build error.
