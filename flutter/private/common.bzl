    A pub package shipping `hook/build.dart` builds its native library at

    missing an entry, and the failure surfaces at runtime as "couldn't resolve
    native function" with nothing pointing at the cause.

    Checked at the application rather than when the spoke repo is generated.
    `flutter.pub()` materialises the whole lock file, so failing at generation
    would fail over packages nothing depends on, and on platforms where the
    hook is irrelevant. Only a package an application actually reaches is a
    problem, and only here is the depending target known.

    rules_dart applies the same rule at `dart_binary` with its own copy. The
    two differ only in the remediation they suggest — a Flutter user fixes this
