"""Resolves the kernel entrypoint for a Flutter app.

This module owns the "what does frontend_server compile as the application
root, and under what library URI" concern.

Hot-reload correctness depends on the running (Bazel-built) kernel keying
the app's libraries under the *same* URIs the dev tool's incremental
compiler uses. The dev tool resolves the app's main to
`package:<name>/main.dart` (via the package_config app entry that
`flutter_compile_kernel` writes), so the user's `main` is always the
compilation root under that `package:` URI. Pre-main setup (plugin
registrant, agent extensions) is NOT interposed here — it lives in the
generated registrant library the engine invokes before `main()` on every
root-isolate launch (see plugin_registrant.bzl), which is what keeps it
alive across hot restart.

    `package_name` exposes a `DartPackageInfo` for the same logical package.
    Drop those duplicate-name transitive entries and append one fresh entry
    for the app itself, retaining the declaring Bazel package root.

    Args:
      packages: List of `DartPackageInfo` (from `collect_packages`).
      package_name: The app's `package_name`. Always non-empty — every
        Flutter consumer rule declares it as a mandatory attribute.

    `part`) into one real directory, then rewrites that package's `lib_root`

    using the exec-root-relative generator so an assembled package's
    `rootUri` resolves to its bazel-out tree artifact. The two steps are
