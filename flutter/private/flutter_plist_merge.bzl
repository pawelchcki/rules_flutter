"""XML property list merging — the additive seam rules_apple does not provide.

`rules_apple` merges `infoplists` natively but takes exactly *one*
`entitlements` file, so an app needing one extra `com.apple.security.*` key
would otherwise have to take over the whole `flutter create` scaffold file
and hand-maintain it. This rule runs the strict rules_flutter plist merger
(`merge_plists.dart`) over a base plist and one or more additions.

Two explicit modes, both never-wrong:

  `strict-add` — additions may only add. A key the base already declares
      with an identical value dedupes silently; a different value is a hard
      error naming the key and both files. This backs the
      `additional_entitlements` attribute of `flutter_macos_app` /
      `flutter_ios_app`.

  `supplement` — the base always wins and same-key string arrays are
      unioned. This backs rules_flutter's own dev-only iOS Dart VM service
      keys, so an app that declares its own `NSBonjourServices` or
      `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` keeps them and still gets a
      debuggable VM service.
