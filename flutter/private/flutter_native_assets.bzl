"""`flutter_native_assets_manifest` — emits the `--native-assets` JSON
manifest the Flutter frontend_server reads.

The frontend_server's `--native-assets` flag points at a JSON file in
the format produced by Flutter's frontend_server (see
`packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/isolated/native_assets/dart_hook_result.dart`
in the flutter/flutter repository). Per-target
section, per-asset entry:

    {
      "format-version": [1, 0, 0],
      "native-assets": {
        "macos_arm64": {
          "package:objective_c/objective_c.dylib": ["absolute", "objective_c.dylib"],
          "package:libsqlite3/libsqlite3.so": ["system", "libsqlite3.so.0"]
        }
      }
    }

The manifest is always emitted, even when the depset is empty
(`{"format-version":[1,0,0],"native-assets":{}}`). That keeps the
kernel-compile path uniform — no `if manifest:` branches downstream.

The Flutter engine reads the relative-path entries verbatim and
`dlopen`s them inside the platform bundle slot:

  * macOS: `<App>.app/Contents/Frameworks/<basename>` (loose dylib)
  * iOS:   `<App>.app/Frameworks/<name>.framework/<name>` — iOS forbids
           loose embedded dylibs, so each `dynamic_loading_bundle` asset is
           wrapped in its own `.framework` (matching flutter_tools'
           `frameworkUri`). The manifest entry is the framework-relative path.
  * Linux: `<bundle>/lib/<basename>` (resolved relative to the runner)
  * Windows: next to the runner exe
  * Android: `lib/<abi>/<basename>` inside the APK

Multi-arch Apple builds are out of scope: rules_flutter targets one
arch per `bazel build` invocation. Universal binaries flow through
`apple_universal_binary` over the dylib outputs at the user's
discretion.
