"""Reads the `sdks:` block a resolver writes at the end of `pubspec.lock`.

Pub records the *constraints* its solution requires, not the SDK that produced
it — so a lock cannot tell you which Flutter resolved it. What it can tell you
is the floor: `flutter: ">=3.18.0-18.0.pre.54"` means no SDK below that can
honour the pinned versions. Checking the pinned toolchain against that floor
catches the direction that ends in a confusing compile error — a lock resolved
by a *newer* Flutter than the build uses.

The other direction (an older resolver silently capping packages at older
versions) leaves no trace in the lock at all: the result is a perfectly valid
solution under the newer SDK. Nothing can detect it after the fact, which is
why `@rules_flutter//flutter:pub` exists — resolving with the pinned toolchain
is the only thing that prevents it.
