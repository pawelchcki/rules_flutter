    platform's build. A target is emitted only when the corresponding attribute
    is provided. Spec `tags` extend the macro-level `tags` (e.g. to mark only
    the mobile platforms `manual`).

    Common `dart_defines`/`build_args`/`mode`/`env` apply to every platform;
    per-platform values merge over them (`build_args` concatenates, dicts merge
    with platform keys winning, `mode` overrides).

      dart_defines: Dict of --dart-define key/value pairs shared by all platforms.
        Supports select(); compose complete dicts per select() branch.
      build_args: Extra flutter build arguments shared by all platforms.
      mode: Build mode (release, profile, debug) shared by all platforms.
      env: Extra action environment variables shared by all platforms.
      android_maven_repo: Vendored Maven/plugin/Flutter-engine closure required
        by apk and appbundle targets and resolved offline by the built-in init script.
      create_dev_target: Whether to emit a runnable `{name}.dev` helper (when
        `web` is configured) that runs `flutter run -d web-server` in the
        source workspace with the hermetic SDK and the web dart_defines.
      dev_run_args: Extra args forwarded to flutter run by the dev helper.
      web: Files or dict spec for the {name}.web target.
      apk: Files or dict spec for the {name}.apk target.
      appbundle: Files or dict spec for the {name}.appbundle target (Android
        App Bundle; requires a registered flutter.android_toolchain).

generated_srcs already mounted, so no source-tree pre-population/refresh is
required) and captures the produced `**/goldens/**` PNG trees as a declared
output — so an unchanged embed/test/lib graph is a cache hit and re-renders
nothing. `bazel run` copies the (cached) goldens back into the source tree for
review and commit.

By default it runs only golden-tagged tests (test_tags = ["golden"]), so a
golden-test failure fails the action but it is NOT a general widget-test gate —
keep a separate flutter_test target for that. The scoping is deliberate:
`--run-skipped` un-skips tests, and limiting it to the golden tag ensures tests
that are `skip: true` for unrelated reasons are never run. Set test_tags = []
to run every test under test_files (only safe when golden is the sole skip).""",
