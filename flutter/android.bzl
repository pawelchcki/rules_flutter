"""Flutter rules for Android builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_android_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_android_app(
            name = "my_app_android",
            application = ":my_app",
            package_name = "com.example.myapp",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=android .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `android/app/src/main/` directory with
    AndroidManifest.xml, resources, and Kotlin sources. The macro handles everything
    automatically — no edits to the flutter create output needed.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl",
            "ANDROID_MIN_SDK_VERSION",
            "ANDROID_TARGET_SDK_VERSION",

            "flutter_android_engine",

            "flutter_android_runner_lib_gen")

        flutter_android_bundle(name = "my_bundle", application = ":my_app")
        flutter_android_engine(name = "my_engine")
        flutter_android_manifest_gen(name = "my_manifest", package_name = "com.example.myapp")

        flutter_android_runner_lib_gen(
            name = "my_runner",
            package_name = "com.example.myapp",
            engine = ":my_engine",
        )

        android_binary(
            name = "my_apk",
            manifest = ":my_manifest",
            deps = [":my_bundle_native_libs", ":my_engine", ":my_runner"],

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `android/app/src/main/`
    directory (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=android .`) and
    wires up all internal targets automatically.

    Three modes, and which one an app is in decides what it can express:
      1. `manifest` provided → uses it directly, with **no** `${...}`
         placeholder preprocessing and no resource/Kotlin auto-discovery.
         Handing this attribute the same `android/app/src/main/`
         AndroidManifest.xml mode 2 would have discovered therefore fails —
         `flutter create` writes `android:name="${applicationName}"` and
         nothing substitutes it. Use mode 2 for `flutter create` output;
         mode 1 is for a manifest you wrote yourself.
      2. android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml found → uses flutter create
         manifest (preprocessed for Gradle variables), discovers resources
         and Kotlin sources from android/app/src/main/. The main manifest is
         used in **every** compilation mode.
      3. No manifest found → generates manifest from template.

    `permissions` adds `<uses-permission>` elements to the effective manifest
    in every mode and every compilation mode, so it is the answer in all
    three — see the attribute's documentation below.

    Debug variant manifests (the Gradle merge Bazel lacks): flutter create
    declares `android.permission.INTERNET` only in
    `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`. Without it a debug APK
    cannot host the Dart VM service (Android enforces INTERNET at the
    kernel level via AID_INET), so hot reload and debugging are impossible.
    This macro folds the debug variant into `-c dbg` APKs, controlled by
    `debug_manifest`:
      - None (default) → discover android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
        when present, its permissions are merged into the main manifest for
        `-c dbg` builds only. Requires a main manifest (mode 1 or 2).
      - a label → merge that variant manifest instead of discovering one.
      - False → no debug variant handling, even if the file exists.
    Release (`-c opt`, the default) APKs always use the main manifest
    unchanged — so a `flutter create` app that networks perfectly in `-c dbg`
    has **no** `INTERNET` permission in release, and Android enforces that at
    the kernel level (AID_INET group membership): every socket fails with
    `EACCES`, with no build error and no diagnostic. The dbg-only grant is a
    *debugging* requirement, not the app's network grant. An app that
    networks must declare it for itself, via `permissions`.
    `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml` is ignored:
    rules_flutter has no profile compilation mode (no profile engine
    artifact exists; the dev tool maps profile to opt).

    When Kotlin sources are found in android/app/src/main/kotlin/, they are
    compiled via kt_android_library with the Flutter engine and AndroidX deps.

    Plugin auto-wiring:
      - Generates a `flutter_android_registrant` target whose application is
        `application`, then compiles the resulting Java into a private
        `kt_android_library` that goes into `binary_deps`. Every plugin
        whose `flutter.plugin.platforms.android.pluginClass` is set ends up
        registered with the FlutterEngine on startup — no manual wiring.
      - Adds `@<pub_hub_name>//android:all_android_plugin_libs` to
        `binary_deps`, pulling in every transitively-resolved plugin
        spoke's Kotlin/Java sources (and resources) via the hub's
        aggregator. Spokes without Android sources contribute empty
        libraries (no-op).
      - Plugins that declare `<uses-permission>` in their library
        manifests (e.g. record_android's RECORD_AUDIO) additionally need
        `common --merge_android_manifest_permissions` in the workspace's
        `.bazelrc`: Bazel's manifest merger strips library permissions by
        default, whereas AGP always merges them.

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). Produces an android_binary.
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        package_name: Android package name, e.g. "com.example.myapp" (required).
        app_name: User-facing display name. Defaults to name.
        android_abi: Target ABI — "arm64" (default) or "x64". Selects the
            engine and the Android platform the application is built for.
        min_sdk_version: Minimum Android SDK version.
        target_sdk_version: Target Android SDK version.
        version_name: Optional Android `versionName`. When omitted, the input
            manifest and rules_android defaults are unchanged.
        version_code: Optional positive Android `versionCode`. When omitted,
            the input manifest and rules_android defaults are unchanged.
        manifest: Override AndroidManifest.xml. If not set, auto-discovered
            from android/app/src/main/ or generated from template.
        debug_manifest: Debug variant manifest merged into `-c dbg` APKs.
            None (default) discovers android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
            a label overrides discovery; False disables variant handling.
        permissions: Permission names — e.g.
            `["android.permission.INTERNET"]` — added to the effective
            manifest in **every** compilation mode and in all three manifest
            modes. This is what a networked app needs: `flutter create`
            grants `INTERNET` in the debug variant only, so without this the
            release APK cannot open a socket. A permission the manifest
            already declares is not duplicated. For a permission wanted in
            `-c dbg` alone, use `debug_manifest` instead; this attribute is
            consumed by the macro and cannot be a `select()`.
        resources: Extra resource_files for android_binary.
        deps: Extra deps for android_binary (e.g. custom android_library).
        pub_hub_name: Name of the `flutter.pub(name = ...)` hub providing
            plugin spokes. The macro depends on
            `@<pub_hub_name>//android:all_android_plugin_libs` to compile
            all plugin Kotlin/Java automatically. Defaults to `"deps"`,
