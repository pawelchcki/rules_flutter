"""Flutter rules for macOS desktop builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_macos_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:macos.bzl", "flutter_macos_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_macos_app(
            name = "my_app_macos",
            application = ":my_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
            app_name = "My App",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=macos .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `macos/Runner/` directory with AppDelegate.swift,
    MainFlutterWindow.swift, MainMenu.xib, and Info.plist.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `macos/Runner/` directory
    (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=macos .`) and wires up all

    Prerequisites — the package must contain:
        - `macos/Runner/*.swift` (AppDelegate, MainFlutterWindow, etc.)
        - `macos/Runner/Base.lproj/MainMenu.xib`
        - `macos/Runner/Info.plist`

        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        bundle_id: CFBundleIdentifier (required — rules_apple constraint).

        minimum_os_version: Minimum macOS version.
        info_plist: Override conventional macos/Runner/Info.plist.
        version: An apple_bundle_version target. Defaults to "1.0".
