"""Extensions for bzlmod.

Installs a Flutter toolchain and optionally resolves pub dependencies
(including Flutter SDK packages like package:flutter).

Every module can define a toolchain version under the default name, "flutter".
The latest of those versions will be selected (the rest discarded),
and will always be registered by rules_flutter.

Additionally, the root module can define arbitrarily many more toolchain versions under different
names (the latest version will be picked for each name) and can register them as it sees fit,
effectively overriding the default named toolchain due to toolchain resolution precedence.
