"""Flutter rules for iOS builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_ios_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl", "flutter_ios_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_ios_app(
            name = "my_app_ios",
            application = ":my_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=ios .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `ios/Runner/` directory with AppDelegate.swift
    and SceneDelegate.swift.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl",
            "IOS_DEFAULT_LAUNCH_STORYBOARD",
            "flutter_ios_engine",

        flutter_ios_engine(name = "my_engine")
        flutter_ios_info_plist_gen(name = "my_info_plist", app_name = "My App")

        flutter_ios_runner_lib_gen(
            name = "my_runner",
            registrant = ":my_registrant",
            engine = ":my_engine",
        )

        ios_application(
            name = "my_ios_app",
            bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
            infoplists = [":my_info_plist"],

                ":my_native_frameworks",
                ":my_runner",

        )

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `ios/Runner/` directory
    (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=ios .`) and wires up all
    internal targets automatically.

    Prerequisites — the package must contain:
        - `ios/Runner/*.swift` (AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, etc.)
    Generate these with: `flutter create --platforms=ios .`

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). The runner's Swift module name
            is derived from it, so it must be a bare Swift identifier.
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        bundle_id: CFBundleIdentifier (required — rules_apple constraint).
        families: Device families (default ["iphone"]).
        app_name: User-facing display name. Defaults to name.
        minimum_os_version: Minimum iOS version.
        info_plist: Override conventional ios/Runner/Info.plist. The macro
            substitutes `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME)` in the conventional plist
            with the runner's module name; an overriding plist that spells
            `UISceneDelegateClassName` out as `Runner.SceneDelegate` will not
            find the scene delegate. Keep the `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME)`
            variable, or write `<name>.SceneDelegate`.
        version: An apple_bundle_version target. Defaults to "1.0".
        launch_storyboard: Override launch storyboard. Defaults to
            ios/Runner/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard.
        entitlements: Override entitlements wiring. By default the macro
            auto-discovers `ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` and forwards
            it to `ios_application`. Unlike macOS (where flutter create
            always emits the entitlements files), iOS only ships
            Runner.entitlements when capabilities are enabled in Xcode;
            its absence is a valid, capability-less app and the macro
            ships nothing rather than synthesizing a default.
        resources: Extra resources. Main.storyboard is wired separately,
            through the runner library, so that ibtool resolves its classes
            against the runner's module. Resources passed here are compiled
            against the app target's name instead, which is not a module any
            target produces — so a storyboard listed here cannot reference the
            runner's Swift classes (an `@objc` class name works regardless).
