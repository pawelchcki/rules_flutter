Build Flutter applications with Bazel. `rules_flutter` supplies hermetic Flutter
toolchains, module extensions for pub.dev dependencies, protobuf-to-Dart
generation, `build_runner` integration, Gazelle language support, and packaging
for web and mobile so teams can ship Flutter code from CI with confidence.

> **Development status:** These rules are evolving quickly. Expect some sharp
> edges while the APIs stabilize.

The external workspace under [`e2e/smoke`](e2e/smoke) is the canonical,
CI-tested reference for everything below: a Flutter web app with localization
codegen and protos ([`flutter_app/`](e2e/smoke/flutter_app)), a `build_runner`
app ([`codegen_app/`](e2e/smoke/codegen_app)), proto packages
([`protos/`](e2e/smoke/protos), [`proto_service/`](e2e/smoke/proto_service)),
and a plain Dart package ([`dart_package/`](e2e/smoke/dart_package)).

## Installation

`rules_flutter` uses bzlmod and requires Bazel 8 or newer. Until a release lands in the Bazel Central Registry,
depend on it with a `git_override` in your `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
bazel_dep(name = "rules_flutter", version = "0.0.0")
git_override(
    module_name = "rules_flutter",
    remote = "https://github.com/SpencerC/rules_flutter.git",
    commit = "<pin a commit from main>",
)
```

The examples later in this README also assume `bazel_dep` entries for
`protobuf`, `bazel_skylib`, and `rules_multirun` where those repositories
appear (and the Gazelle section additionally needs `gazelle`,
`rules_flutter_gazelle`, and `bazel_skylib_gazelle_plugin`). See
[`e2e/smoke/MODULE.bazel`](e2e/smoke/MODULE.bazel) for a complete working
example.

### Register a Flutter toolchain

The `flutter` extension downloads a platform-appropriate SDK and registers
toolchains, so no host Flutter install is needed:

```starlark
flutter = use_extension("@rules_flutter//flutter:extensions.bzl", "flutter")
flutter.toolchain(
    flutter_version = "3.38.4",
    # Artifact groups that must be present in the SDK cache after fetch.
    # Stable archives already ship web, Android, and the host desktop
    # platform (plus iOS on macOS); anything missing is fetched via
    # `flutter precache` at repository fetch time.
    precache = ["web", "android", "ios"],
)
use_repo(
    flutter,
    "flutter_sdk",
    "flutter_toolchains",
)
register_toolchains("@flutter_toolchains//:all")
```

#### Using a version not in the built-in table

`flutter_version` normally must be one of the versions shipped in
`flutter/private/versions.bzl` (run `bazel run //tools:update_flutter_versions`
to add the latest stable releases). To pin a version that is not yet in that
table — a brand-new stable release, or a specific older build — supply its
archive integrity per platform:

```starlark
flutter.toolchain(
    flutter_version = "3.40.0",
    integrity = {
        # SRI of the stable release archive for each platform you build on.
        "macos": "sha256-...",
        "linux": "sha256-...",
        # "windows": "sha256-...",
    },
)
```

Only the platforms you actually build on need an entry — the per-platform SDK
repositories are fetched lazily, so a missing entry only fails if something
builds for that platform. Compute each SRI from the stable archive URL, e.g.

```sh
curl -sL "https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_3.40.0-stable.zip" \
  | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl base64 -A
# prefix the result with "sha256-"
```

Prefer adding the version to `versions.bzl` for anything long-lived; the
`integrity` map is an escape hatch for one-off or bleeding-edge pins.

> **Version selection.** When more than one module registers the same-named
> toolchain, the highest version wins (compared semver-aware). `rules_flutter`
> itself registers a default version, so pinning a lower version through the
> escape hatch has no effect — the default is selected instead. The `integrity`
> you supply is bound to its exact version and is never applied to a different
> version that wins selection.

#### SDK hermeticity guarantees

The SDK repository is immutable after fetch:

- The release archive is downloaded with integrity verification, and the
  launcher's engine-version refresh is patched at fetch time so `flutter`
  invocations never write into the repository.
- `bin/cache` and Flutter tool's vendored pub cache are sealed read-only; any
  residual write attempt fails the build loudly instead of silently mutating
  shared state. (The one exception: the
  iOS/macOS engine framework directories keep owner-write, because
  `flutter build ios` copies them permissions-preserved into the app's build
  directory and codesigns the copies in place — the tool never writes the
  originals.)
- Build actions run with `FLUTTER_ALREADY_LOCKED`, `--no-version-check`, and a
  scratch `HOME`, so no lockfiles, stamps, or analytics/config writes escape
  the sandbox.

Do not run `flutter precache` or `flutter config` against the Bazel-provided
SDK from scripts: it is unnecessary and the sealed cache will reject it. See
[docs/hermeticity.md](docs/hermeticity.md) for the full per-platform contract.

The downloaded SDK is a runtime distribution, not a Flutter contributor
checkout: its `dev/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, and editor/CI trees are pruned.
Use a separate Flutter checkout for SDK contribution workflows.

## Managing pub.dev dependencies

`rules_flutter` ships a `pub` module extension that reads the `pubspec.lock`
files you declare — the same locks `pub` itself writes — and turns each into a
**hub** repository carrying that lock's whole hosted package closure. Add it
next to the Flutter extension and declare one hub per lock:

```starlark
pub = use_extension("@rules_flutter//flutter:extensions.bzl", "pub")
pub.lock(
    name = "app_deps",
    file = "//app:pubspec.lock",
)
use_repo(pub, "app_deps")
```

Depend on `@app_deps//:all` to get the closure, or on `@app_deps//:<package>`
for one package of it. Because a lock is a complete, single-version-per-package
solution by construction, the hub is exactly the set of packages the app
resolves to — no dependency edges between packages are needed, and the
pub universe's genuine cycles (e.g. `dio <-> dio_web_adapter`) simply never
enter the Bazel graph. Each lock gets its own hub, so two apps may pin
different versions of the same package.

Each Flutter/Dart package in your workspace keeps a `pubspec.lock` next to its
`pubspec.yaml`. The `flutter_library` and `dart_library` macros emit a runnable
`{name}.update` helper that refreshes it with the **toolchain-pinned** Flutter
SDK (`dart_library` only when a `pubspec` is set), so the maintenance loop when
dependencies change is:

```bash
# 1. Edit pubspec.yaml.
# 2. Re-resolve (also creates the lock the first time):
bazel run //my_app:lib.update
# 3. Keep use_repo in sync. The extension reports its hubs exactly, so this
#    now adds and prunes entries on its own.
bazel mod tidy
# 4. Commit pubspec.yaml, pubspec.lock, and MODULE.bazel together.
```

Optional `pub.package` tags add packages that no lock references — typically
tools executed during the build, which keep their own fetch-time closure and
therefore sit outside every hub:

```starlark
pub.package(name = "pub_freezed", package = "freezed", version = "2.4.5")
```

A module with no locks at all says so explicitly with `pub.no_locks()`; the
extension refuses to silently do nothing.

## Defining libraries: flutter_library

`flutter_library` prepares a Flutter package for hermetic builds and tests: it
assembles the package workspace, an offline pub cache, and package metadata
that `flutter_app`, `flutter_test`, and `flutter_analyze_test` reuse via
`embed`. Adapted (abridged) from
[`e2e/smoke/flutter_app/BUILD.bazel`](e2e/smoke/flutter_app/BUILD.bazel):

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_library")

flutter_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = ["lib/main.dart"],
    data = glob(["l10n/**"]),                     # assets/l10n inputs for codegen
    pubspec = "pubspec.yaml",
    # lock defaults to the sibling "pubspec.lock".
    generator_commands = ["intl_utils:generate"],  # one-shot codegen (see below)
    generated_srcs = {
        # dart_proto_library outputs mounted under lib/generated (see below).
        "//protos/api/v1:services_api_v1_proto_dart": "lib/generated",
    },
    deps = [
        "@flutter_sdk//flutter/packages/flutter",
        "@flutter_sdk//flutter/packages/flutter_localizations",
        "@flutter_sdk//flutter/packages/flutter_test",
        "@app_deps//:all",
    ],
)
```

- **`srcs`** are the package sources (`lib/`, etc.); **`data`** carries
  additional files (assets, l10n ARB files) needed for code generation or
  embedding.
- **`pubspec`** is required; **`lock`** defaults to `pubspec.lock` in the
  same package and must be checked in (see the dependency loop above).
- **`deps`** accepts other `flutter_library`/`dart_library` targets, the hub
  for this package's lock (`@<hub>//:all`), and the SDK-vendored packages
  under `@flutter_sdk//flutter/packages/...`.
- The macro also emits the `{name}.update` helper described above
  (`create_update_target = False` opts out).

Plain Dart packages use `dart_library` the same way; `pubspec`/`lock` are
optional there (see [`e2e/smoke/dart_package`](e2e/smoke/dart_package)).

## Code generation

### One-shot generators

`generator_commands` runs each `<package>:<script>` generator while the
library's dependencies are prepared (the entrypoint is resolved from the
package config and invoked directly rather than via `dart run`, which would
attempt an implicit `pub get`), so generated sources exist inside the
Bazel-prepared workspace without being checked in. For example,
`generator_commands = ["intl_utils:generate"]` produces the localization
bindings for the smoke app.

### build_runner

`flutter_library` and `dart_library` have first-class `build_runner` support:

- `build_runner_modes = ["build"]` runs `build_runner build` **inside the
  Bazel action**, fully offline: the entrypoint is resolved from the prepared
  package config (no implicit `pub get`), the checked-in `pubspec.lock` is
  staged into the prepared workspace so build_runner reads a genuine lock, and
  `--delete-conflicting-outputs` is applied by default. Generated sources
  (e.g. `*.g.dart`, `assets.gen.dart`)
  therefore never need to be checked in — see
  [`e2e/smoke/codegen_app`](e2e/smoke/codegen_app) for a working example
  combining `copy_with_extension_gen` and `flutter_gen_runner`.
- Omitting `build_runner_modes` emits runnable helper targets for all modes:
  `:<name>.build_runner_build`, `:<name>.build_runner_test`,
  `:<name>.build_runner_watch`, and `:<name>.build_runner_serve`. Setting
  `build_runner_modes` narrows both the emitted helpers and the action-backed
  behavior.
- `build_runner_common_args` applies to every mode;
  `build_runner_build_args`/`build_runner_test_args`/`build_runner_watch_args`/
  `build_runner_serve_args` are per-mode. `build_runner_create_run_targets =
False` suppresses the helpers.

```starlark
flutter_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**"]),
    build_runner_modes = ["build"],
    data = glob(["assets/**"]),
    pubspec = "pubspec.yaml",
    deps = [
        "@flutter_sdk//flutter/packages/flutter",
        "@pub_build_runner//:build_runner",
        "@pub_copy_with_extension//:copy_with_extension",
        "@pub_copy_with_extension_gen//:copy_with_extension_gen",
        "@pub_flutter_gen_runner//:flutter_gen_runner",
    ],
)
```

The helper targets are normal executables, so they compose directly with
`rules_multirun`:

```starlark
load("@rules_multirun//:defs.bzl", "command", "multirun")

command(
    name = "app_watch",
    command = "//flutter_app:lib.build_runner_watch",
)

command(
    name = "app_serve",
    command = "//flutter_app:lib.build_runner_serve",
)

multirun(
    name = "app_dev",
    commands = [
        ":app_watch",
        ":app_serve",
    ],
    jobs = 0,
)
```

### Mounting generated sources: generated_srcs

Generated Dart produced by _other Bazel targets_ — most commonly
`dart_proto_library` output — is mounted at an explicit directory inside the
package workspace with `generated_srcs`, so imports resolve during codegen,
builds, and tests without checking generated files in:

```starlark
flutter_library(
    name = "app_lib",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**"], exclude = ["lib/generated/**"]),
    generated_srcs = {
        "//protos/api/v1:services_api_v1_proto_dart": "lib/generated",
    },
    pubspec = "pubspec.yaml",
    deps = ["@pub_protobuf//:protobuf"],
)
```

`dart_proto_library` targets mount each file at its proto-import-relative path
under the destination directory (so `api/v1/service.proto` becomes
`lib/generated/api/v1/service.pb.dart`, imported as
`package:my_app/generated/api/v1/service.pb.dart`); other targets mount flat by
basename.

## Protobuf: dart_proto_library

`dart_proto_library` wraps the Dart protoc plugin (run from its own pinned pub
repository) behind an aspect that walks the `proto_library` dependency
closure: generation covers every proto in the transitive closure, including
well-known types such as `google/protobuf/timestamp`, matching what generated
imports expect. gRPC stubs are always generated for protos that declare
services (the `grpc` attribute is deprecated and ignored).

The convention — like `go_proto_library` — is one collocated
`dart_proto_library` per `proto_library`, in the same package:

```starlark
# protos/api/v1/BUILD.bazel
load("@protobuf//bazel:proto_library.bzl", "proto_library")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "dart_proto_library")

proto_library(
    name = "services_api_v1_proto",
    srcs = ["service.proto"],
    # Import path becomes api/v1/service.proto.
    strip_import_prefix = "/protos/",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = ["@protobuf//:timestamp_proto"],
)

dart_proto_library(
    name = "services_api_v1_proto_dart",
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = [":services_api_v1_proto"],
)
```

There are two ways to consume the generated Dart:

```starlark
# 1. dart_library: depend on it directly; the generated sources join the
#    library's sources.
dart_library(
    name = "proto_client",
    srcs = ["lib/client.dart"],
    deps = ["//protos/api/v1:services_api_v1_proto_dart"],
)

# 2. flutter_library: mount it at a package path with generated_srcs so app
#    code imports package:my_app/generated/api/v1/service.pb.dart.
flutter_library(
    name = "lib",
    generated_srcs = {
        "//protos/api/v1:services_api_v1_proto_dart": "lib/generated",
    },
    ...
)
```

### Prebuilt protoc

By default the aspect invokes the source-built `@protobuf//:protoc`, which
drags protobuf's C++ compilation graph (tens of thousands of configured
targets) into analysis. `dart_proto_library` supports
[proto toolchain resolution](https://protobuf.dev/support/migration/#toolchain-resolution):
with `--incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution` set, protoc comes from
the resolved proto toolchain instead, so registering a prebuilt one — e.g.
[toolchains_protoc](https://github.com/aspect-build/toolchains_protoc) —
removes that graph entirely:

```starlark
# MODULE.bazel
bazel_dep(name = "toolchains_protoc", version = "0.6.1")

protoc = use_extension("@toolchains_protoc//protoc:extensions.bzl", "protoc")
protoc.toolchain(version = "v33.0")
use_repo(protoc, "toolchains_protoc_hub")

register_toolchains("@toolchains_protoc_hub//:all")
```

```
# .bazelrc
common --incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution
```

## Building apps: flutter_app

`flutter_app` is a macro that emits one target per configured platform —
`{name}.web`, `{name}.apk`, `{name}.appbundle`, `{name}.ios`, `{name}.macos`,
`{name}.linux`, `{name}.windows` — plus an alias `{name}` pointing at the first
configured platform in that fixed order (web, apk, appbundle, ios, macos,
linux, windows):

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_app")

flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    embed = [":lib"],
    web = {
        "srcs": glob(["web/**"]),
        "build_args": ["--source-maps"],
    },
)
```

```bash
bazel build //my_app:app.web        # build the web bundle
bazel run //my_app:app.web -- 9000  # serve the built bundle locally
```

### Platform dict specs

Each platform attribute accepts either overlay files (a label or list of
labels, treated as `srcs`) or a dict spec with any of these keys:

| Key                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcs`               | Files overlaid into the build workspace for this platform (e.g. `web/`, `android/`, `ios/` directories).                                                                   |
| `dart_defines`       | Dict of `--dart-define` key/value pairs, read in Dart via `String.fromEnvironment`.                                                                                        |
| `build_args`         | Extra arguments appended verbatim to `flutter build`.                                                                                                                      |
| `mode`               | Build mode: `release` (default), `profile`, or `debug`.                                                                                                                    |
| `env`                | Extra environment variables exported in the build action.                                                                                                                  |
| `android_maven_repo` | Complete vendored Maven/plugin/Flutter-engine closure required by `apk`/`appbundle`.                                                                                       |
| `android_test`       | `apk` only: additionally build the instrumentation APK (see [Mobile builds](#mobile-builds)).                                                                              |
| `build_name`         | Overrides the pubspec version name (`--build-name`).                                                                                                                       |
| `build_number`       | Label of a `string_flag`; its value (when non-empty) is passed as `--build-number`.                                                                                        |
| `tags`               | Extra tags for this platform's target, added to the macro-level `tags` (e.g. `["manual"]` to keep mobile targets out of wildcard builds on machines without the host SDK). |

`dart_defines`, `build_args`, `mode`, and `env`
can also be set at the macro level, shared by all platforms. Per-platform
values merge over the shared ones: `build_args` concatenates after the shared
list, dicts merge with platform keys winning, and `mode` overrides.

### Per-environment configuration

`dart_defines` and `mode` are configurable with `select()`, so a single
`string_flag` can key dev/staging/prod builds. One Starlark limitation to know
about: two `select()`s cannot be merged, so when using `select()` compose the
complete dict per branch (and put it on either the shared attribute or the
platform spec, not both).

```starlark
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")

string_flag(
    name = "env",
    build_setting_default = "dev",
    values = ["dev", "staging", "prod"],
)

config_setting(
    name = "staging",
    flag_values = {":env": "staging"},
)

config_setting(
    name = "prod",
    flag_values = {":env": "prod"},
)

flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    embed = [":lib"],
    dart_defines = select({
        ":prod": {"API_ENDPOINT": "api.example.com", "ENV_NAME": "prod"},
        ":staging": {"API_ENDPOINT": "api.staging.example.com", "ENV_NAME": "staging"},
        "//conditions:default": {"API_ENDPOINT": "api.dev.example.com", "ENV_NAME": "dev"},
    }),
    mode = select({
        ":prod": "release",
        "//conditions:default": "debug",
    }),
    web = {"srcs": glob(["web/**"])},
)
```

```bash
bazel build //my_app:app.web --//my_app:env=prod
```

For the common mobile-release axis — a build `mode` flag plus a
`build_number` a release wrapper injects — the `flutter_build_settings` macro
emits the `string_flag`s and per-mode `config_setting`s for you:

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_app", "flutter_build_settings")

# Emits :settings_mode (debug/profile/release), :settings_{debug,profile,release}
# config_settings, and :settings_build_number.
flutter_build_settings(name = "settings", mode_default = "debug")

flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    embed = [":lib"],
    apk = {
        "srcs": [":android_srcs"],
        "mode": select({
            ":settings_release": "release",
            "//conditions:default": "debug",
        }),
        "build_number": ":settings_build_number",
        "android_sdk": "@androidsdk//:sdk_path",
    },
)
```

```bash
bazel build //my_app:app.appbundle \
    --//my_app:settings_mode=release --//my_app:settings_build_number=42
```

### Development server

Apps with a `web` platform also emit a `{name}.dev` helper that runs
`flutter run -d web-server` in your **source** workspace using the hermetic
SDK — hot reload included, no host Flutter install required. It inherits the
web platform's `dart_defines`, so per-environment config flows through:

```bash
bazel run //my_app:app.dev --//my_app:env=dev -- --web-port=8080
```

Opt out with `create_dev_target = False`; pass fixed args via
`dev_run_args = [...]`.

## Mobile builds

Web builds and tests are fully hermetic (package configs are regenerated from
`pubspec.lock` with no pub resolution and no network). Mobile builds are
different: they drive Gradle/Xcode, so the actions are **declared
non-hermetic** (`no-sandbox`, `requires-network`, `no-remote-exec`; mnemonics
`FlutterBuildAndroid` and `FlutterBuildIos`, the latter also
`requires-darwin`). Pub dependencies still never touch the network: mobile
targets run `flutter pub get --offline` against a mutable copy of the
assembled pub cache to regenerate Flutter's plugin registrants. See
[docs/hermeticity.md](docs/hermeticity.md) for the exact contract per target.

A runnable example lives at
[`e2e/smoke/flutter_app`](e2e/smoke/flutter_app/BUILD.bazel): the
`//flutter_app:mobile.apk` and `//flutter_app:mobile.ios` targets are tagged
`manual` (they need the host prerequisites below) and build a debug APK and an
unsigned `Runner.app` from the same `flutter_library` as the web app.

### Android (apk / appbundle)

`{name}.apk` and `{name}.appbundle` are hermetic by default. The module
extension pins the SDK, build tools, optional NDK, and extracted Gradle
distribution; the app supplies its complete Maven mirror.

```starlark
# MODULE.bazel
flutter.android_toolchain(
    sdk_version = "35",
    build_tools_version = "35.0.0",
    ndk_version = "r25c",  # optional
    gradle_distribution_url = "https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.7-bin.zip",
    gradle_distribution_integrity = "sha256-...",
)
use_repo(flutter, "android_toolchains")
register_toolchains("@android_toolchains//:all")
```

```
# .bazelrc — after reviewing the licenses
common --repo_env=ACCEPTED_ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE_VERSION=35
common --repo_env=ACCEPTED_ANDROID_NDK_LICENSE_VERSION=r25c
```

```starlark
# BUILD.bazel
load("@bazel_skylib//rules:common_settings.bzl", "string_flag")

string_flag(
    name = "android_build_number",
    build_setting_default = "",
)

flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    embed = [":lib"],
    apk = {
        "srcs": glob(["android/**"]),
        "android_maven_repo": "//android:maven_mirror",
        "build_number": ":android_build_number",
        "android_test": True,
    },
    appbundle = {
        "srcs": glob(["android/**"]),
        "android_maven_repo": "//android:maven_mirror",
        "build_number": ":android_build_number",
    },
)
```

```bash
# Release wrappers inject the next Play Store version code:
bazel build //my_app:app.appbundle --//my_app:android_build_number=42
```

Notes:

- **Maven closure:** `android_maven_repo` is mandatory and must contain every
  application dependency, Gradle plugin, and Flutter engine artifact. The
  built-in init script replaces all repositories and forces Gradle offline;
  missing artifacts therefore fail immediately.
- **Execution:** SDK/NDK, JDK, Gradle, Maven, Flutter, pub cache, sources, and
  helper scripts are declared inputs. Android actions are sandboxable,
  remotely cacheable, and remote-execution eligible by default.

- **Firebase Test Lab:** `android_test = True` (apk only) additionally runs
  Gradle's `app:assembleAndroidTest` after the Flutter build and copies the
  instrumentation APK under `androidTest/` in the build artifacts — the
  two-APK layout Firebase Test Lab's instrumentation testing expects.

### iOS

`{name}.ios` requires a host Xcode installation (`xcodebuild`) and CocoaPods —
the standard declared prerequisites for Bazel Apple builds; Flutter drives
`pod install` itself. Under `--incompatible_strict_action_env` the action
probes the common CocoaPods install locations (Homebrew, `/usr/local/bin`,
gem paths) before giving up.

```starlark
flutter_app(
    name = "app",
    embed = [":lib"],
    ios = {
        "srcs": glob(["ios/**"]),
        "mode": "release",
    },
)
```

Tips:

- The iOS action keeps the caller's `HOME` when the build passes it through,
  so CocoaPods spec/pod caches persist across builds; otherwise it falls back
  to a scratch dir. To opt in:

  ```
  build --action_env=HOME
  ```

- `RULES_FLUTTER_CP_HOME` (via `--action_env`) sets CocoaPods' `CP_HOME_DIR`
  explicitly.

## Testing

All three test rules run hermetically — no host Flutter, no network.
`flutter_test` and `flutter_analyze_test` run from the prepared
`flutter_library` workspace; `dart_format_test` simply runs the toolchain's
`dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed` over its `srcs`:

```starlark
load(
    "@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl",
    "dart_format_test",
    "flutter_analyze_test",
    "flutter_test",
)

# flutter test --no-pub against the prepared workspace.
flutter_test(
    name = "lib_test",
    srcs = glob(["test/**"]),
    embed = [":lib"],
    # test_files = ["test/"],  # patterns forwarded to flutter test
)

# flutter analyze --no-pub; overlay analysis_options.yaml / test sources.
flutter_analyze_test(
    name = "lib_analyze",
    srcs = glob(["test/**"]),
    embed = [":lib"],
    # fatal_infos = True, fatal_warnings = False, extra_args = [...]
)

# Fails when sources are not `dart format` clean.
dart_format_test(
    name = "lib_format",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart", "test/**/*.dart"]),
)
```

```bash
bazel test //my_app:all
```

## Write-back helpers

`dart_format_test` fails on unformatted code; to _fix_ it in place, run the
`{name}.format` helper the `flutter_library`/`dart_library` macros emit
(`dart format` over the package source directory):

```bash
bazel run //my_app:lib.format          # format the whole package
bazel run //my_app:lib.format -- lib   # or specific paths
```

When a library sets `generated_srcs`, the macros also emit `{name}.sync`,
which writes those generated sources (e.g. `dart_proto_library` outputs) into
the source tree so the IDE analyzer resolves them. The hermetic build never
needs this — it mounts the same outputs into its sandbox automatically — so
keep the synced directory gitignored:

```bash
bazel run //my_app:lib.sync            # refresh lib/generated for the IDE
```

Both helpers are opt-out via `create_format_target = False` /
`create_sync_target = False` on the macro.

## Gazelle automation

The Gazelle plugins ship as their own Bazel module,
`rules_flutter_gazelle`, so that consumers who don't use Gazelle never
resolve Go rules or a Go toolchain. Depend on it as a dev dependency —
BUILD-file generation is repo tooling, not something your dependents need:

```starlark
# MODULE.bazel
bazel_dep(name = "gazelle", version = "0.36.0", dev_dependency = True, repo_name = "bazel_gazelle")
bazel_dep(name = "rules_flutter_gazelle", version = "0.0.0", dev_dependency = True)
```

Then compose a custom binary with the languages you need:

```starlark
# BUILD.bazel
load("@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle", "gazelle_binary")

gazelle_binary(
    name = "gazelle_bin",
    languages = [
        "@bazel_skylib_gazelle_plugin//bzl",
        "@bazel_gazelle//language/proto",
        "@rules_flutter_gazelle//flutter",
        "@rules_flutter_gazelle//dartproto",
    ],
)

gazelle(
    name = "gazelle",
    gazelle = "gazelle_bin",
)
```

Run Gazelle whenever files move or dependencies change:

```bash
bazel run //:gazelle
```

## Documentation and examples

- [docs/rules.md](docs/rules.md) — generated API reference for every rule and
  attribute.
- [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) — generated reference for the
  `flutter` and `pub` module extensions.
- [docs/hermeticity.md](docs/hermeticity.md) — the hermeticity contract: what
  is sealed, what is declared non-hermetic, and why.
- [docs/migrating.md](docs/migrating.md) — migrating an existing Flutter app
  to Bazel.
- [e2e/smoke](e2e/smoke) — the runnable example workspace exercised in CI
  (`cd e2e/smoke && bazel test //:integration_tests`).

## Troubleshooting

Build `--verbose_failures` and `--subcommands` show the exact command a failing
Flutter action ran; the dependency-preparation action also tees its output to
`bazel-bin/<pkg>/<target>_pub_prepare.log`. See the
[Troubleshooting section of docs/hermeticity.md](docs/hermeticity.md#troubleshooting)
for the common failures (toolchain not registered, unknown version, SDK
integrity mismatch, stale `pubspec.lock`, sealed-cache write, slow remote
execution) and how to resolve each.

## Working on rules_flutter

- **Run all tests:** `bazel test //...`
- **Core rule coverage:** `bazel test //flutter/tests:all_tests`
- **External smoke tests:** `cd e2e/smoke && bazel test //:integration_tests`
- **Regenerate BUILD files:** `bazel run //:gazelle` (and the smoke workspace equivalent)
- **Gazelle plugin Go tests:** `cd gazelle && bazel test //...`
- **Format BUILD/Starlark:** `bazel run @buildifier_prebuilt//:buildifier`
- **Update Flutter SDK metadata:** `bazel run //tools:update_flutter_versions`
- **Install hooks:** `pre-commit install`

## Roadmap

`rules_flutter` is being delivered in three major stages—Alpha, Beta, and Production-readiness. This roadmap captures what is already in place and what remains to ship a dependable 1.0.

### ✅ Alpha foundations (complete)

- Established Bazel workspace layout, CI scaffolding, and contributor tooling (buildifier, pre-commit, update scripts).
- Implemented Flutter SDK toolchains with version pinning, integrity verification, and bzlmod module extensions.
- Landed core rules (`dart_library`, `flutter_library`, `flutter_app`, `flutter_test`) with providers, transitions, and pub cache management.
- Delivered hermetic execution scaffolding: offline pub caches, reproducible `flutter build/test` invocation.
- Implemented `dart_proto_library`.
- Implemented Gazelle plugins.
- Native support for `build_runner` (in-action `build` plus run helpers).
- Added verification suites: unit tests, smoke e2e workspace, and publishing of SDK metadata through automation.

### 🚢 Beta: Hermetic cross-platform builds (in progress)

- Normalize build outputs for APK/AAB/IPA/web bundles and document how to consume them from Bazel.
- Optimize incremental and remote builds by trimming redundant copies, exercising RBE, and benchmarking cache hit rates.
- Harden failure surfacing with structured action logs, actionable diagnostics, and better toolchain validation.
- Expand automated coverage: multi-platform e2e matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows), release build assertions, and remote execution smoke tests.
- Produce task-oriented docs: quickstarts, troubleshooting, and upgrade guides covering common Flutter/Bazel workflows.

### 🛫 Production readiness (planned)

- Ship CI-backed Android packaging (APK/AAB) with managed SDKs, signing hooks, and release build examples.
- Complete iOS/macOS pipelines with codesign-aware actions, xcframework integration, and Apple toolchain configuration rules.
- Deliver Windows and Linux desktop bundling, including runtime discovery, asset staging, and exe/appimage installers.
- Support advanced Flutter UX: declarative asset rules, localization packaging, configurable build flavors, and web performance tuning.
- Introduce extensibility: plugin federation, native interop helpers, and more code generation entry points.

### 🎯 Release checkpoints

- ✅ Alpha: Hermetic builds proven with web/mobile smoke apps and documented setup.
- 🎯 Beta: Android & iOS packaging validated on CI runners with reference apps and published consumption docs.
- 🏁 1.0: Multi-platform builds, plugin support, asset workflows, and production-ready docs/tests all green on continuous CI and remote execution.
