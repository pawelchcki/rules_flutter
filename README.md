# rules_flutter

> **Status: v0.0.1 — early/alpha.** Usable today, but the public API may change before 1.0. Feedback and contributions welcome.

Bazel rules for building Flutter applications. Provides Bazel-native compilation, asset bundling, AOT compilation, and platform-specific packaging for all Flutter target platforms.

Built on top of [rules_dart](https://github.com/aran/rules_dart) for Dart compilation and delegates platform packaging to mature ecosystem rulesets (`rules_android`, `rules_apple`, etc.).

## Why Bazel?

If you're already using `flutter build`, here's what you gain by switching to Bazel:

- **Hermetic, reproducible builds** — every input is tracked; the same source always produces the same output, regardless of machine state.
- **Remote caching** — build artifacts are content-addressed and shared across your team. A change that only touches one package doesn't rebuild anything else.
- **Remote Build Execution (RBE)** — offload compilation to cloud workers. Build macOS, Linux, and Android targets from the same `bazel build` invocation.
- **Monorepo interoperability** — Flutter apps, backend services, Rust libraries, C++ libraries, and infrastructure code all live in one build graph with correct dependency tracking.
- **Native code composition** — depend on `cc_library`, `rust_shared_library`, or `swift_library` targets directly via `native_deps`. No CMake, no Gradle, no CocoaPods.
- **No build_runner** — code generators (json_serializable, freezed, etc.) run as hermetic Bazel actions via `dart_codegen`.

## Compatibility

- **Bazel**: 9+
- **Flutter SDK**: 3.44.1

## Prerequisites

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| All | Bazel 9+ |
| macOS | Xcode (for `rules_apple` and `rules_swift`) |
| iOS | Xcode + valid signing identity (simulator works without signing) |
| Android | Android SDK (`$ANDROID_HOME` set), Android NDK (`$ANDROID_NDK_HOME` set), rules_android, rules_android_ndk, rules_kotlin |
| Linux | C++ toolchain (native or LLVM cross-toolchain from macOS) |
| Windows | MSVC (native builds), or C++ cross-toolchain (debug JIT only from macOS/Linux) |
| Web | None (Dart-to-WASM/JS compilation is fully hermetic) |

## Required `.bazelrc`

rules_flutter's transitive Java toolchain (`rules_jvm_external` 7+, `rules_android` 0.7.2+) ships internal tool jars compiled at Java 21+ and uses Java 14+ language features in its sources. Bazel's defaults for the tool exec configuration are older than that, so without setting them explicitly you will hit either `UnsupportedClassVersionError` at action execution time or `could not locate class file for java.lang.Record` at compile time.

Windows builds additionally require Bazel symlink support, which `rules_python` 2.0+ depends on.

Paste this block into your project's `.bazelrc`:

```bazelrc
# Required for rules_flutter — bumps the tool exec JDK above Bazel's
# `remotejdk_11` default so transitive rulesets' Java 21+ tool jars run.
common --tool_java_language_version=25
common --tool_java_runtime_version=remotejdk_25

# Required on Windows for rules_python 2+.
startup --windows_enable_symlinks
```

## Quickstart

Add the following to your `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
bazel_dep(
    name = "rules_flutter",
    version = <latest from registry.bazel.build/modules/rules_flutter>,
)

flutter = use_extension("@rules_flutter//flutter:extensions.bzl", "flutter")
flutter.toolchain(flutter_version = "3.44.1")
use_repo(flutter, "flutter_toolchains")

register_toolchains("@flutter_toolchains//:all")
```

Then in your `BUILD.bazel`:

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application", "flutter_library")

flutter_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart"]),
    assets = glob(["assets/**"]),
)

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)
```

`flutter_application` is the core compilation target shared by all platforms. It produces a `FlutterApplicationInfo` provider that platform-specific packaging rules consume.

`package_name` is required — it matches `pubspec.yaml`'s `name:` field, keys the kernel under stable `package:` URIs for hot reload, and lets the compile reach codegen siblings.

## Debug vs Release Builds

Build mode is controlled by Bazel's standard compilation mode flag:

| Flag | Mode | Compilation | Use case |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| `-c dbg` | Debug | Kernel `.dill` (JIT) | Development, hot reload |
| (default) | Fastbuild | AOT native code | CI, testing |
| `-c opt` | Release | AOT native code (stripped) | Production |

## Cross-Compilation

`gen_snapshot` (the AOT compiler) is a cross-compiler: it runs on the host but produces code for the target. Different binaries exist per host/target pair.

### Host-to-Target Matrix

| Host | Target | AOT (release) | JIT (debug) | Notes |
|------|--------|:---:|:---:|-------|
| macOS | macOS | Yes | Yes | Native build |
| macOS | iOS | Yes | Yes | Via `rules_apple` platform transition |
| macOS | Android | Yes | Yes | Automatic platform transition in the Android rules |
| macOS | Linux | No | Yes | Cross-compile with LLVM CC toolchain; JIT only (no cross gen_snapshot for desktop) |
| macOS | Windows | No | Yes | JIT only; requires Windows CC cross-toolchain |
| macOS | Web | Yes | N/A | Web uses dart2wasm/dart2js, not gen_snapshot |
| Linux | Linux | Yes | Yes | Native build |
| Linux | Android | Yes | Yes | Automatic platform transition in the Android rules |
| Linux | iOS | No | No | Requires Xcode (macOS only) |
| Linux | Web | Yes | N/A | |
| Windows | Windows | Yes | Yes | Native build |
| Windows | Android | Yes | Yes | Automatic platform transition in the Android rules |
| Windows | Web | Yes | N/A | |

**Key limitation:** Desktop-to-desktop AOT cross-compilation (e.g. macOS→Linux release) is not supported because Flutter does not publish cross-gen_snapshot binaries for desktop targets. Use debug/JIT mode for cross-compiled desktop bundles, or build natively on the target platform.

## Platform Rules

Each platform has a **Tier 1 convenience macro** (recommended) and **Tier 2 composable rules** (advanced).

The Tier 1 macros auto-discover runner files from `flutter create` output and wire up all internal targets. The Tier 2 rules give full control over each component.

### macOS

> **macOS only** — requires Xcode and `rules_apple`.

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:macos.bzl", "flutter_macos_app")

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)

flutter_macos_app(
    name = "my_app_macos",
    application = ":my_app",
    bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
    app_name = "My App",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=macos .` to generate `macos/Runner/` with Swift sources and XIB files.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target (required). |
| `bundle_id` | macOS bundle identifier (required). |
| `app_name` | Display name (menu bar, window title). Defaults to target name. |
| `minimum_os_version` | Minimum macOS version. Default: `"10.14"`. |
| `info_plist` | Override the conventional `macos/Runner/Info.plist`. |
| `version` | An `apple_bundle_version` target. Defaults to `"1.0"`. |

Produces a `.app` bundle with `FlutterMacOS.framework`, `App.framework`, and `flutter_assets/`.

    bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
    additional_contents = {
        ":my_framework": "Frameworks",
        ":my_native_libs": "Frameworks",
    },
    infoplists = [":my_info_plist"],
    resources = [":my_menu_xib"],
    deps = [":my_runner"],
)
```

</details>

### iOS

> **macOS only** — requires Xcode, `rules_apple`, and `rules_swift`.

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl", "flutter_ios_app")

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)

flutter_ios_app(
    name = "my_app_ios",
    application = ":my_app",
    bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=ios .` to generate `ios/Runner/` with Swift sources.

Add to your `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
use_repo(flutter, "flutter_toolchains", "flutter_ios_engine")
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target (required). |
| `bundle_id` | iOS bundle identifier (required). |
| `families` | Device families. Default: `["iphone"]`. |
| `app_name` | Display name. Defaults to target name. |
| `minimum_os_version` | Minimum iOS version. Default: `"12.0"`. |
| `info_plist` | Override conventional `ios/Runner/Info.plist`. |
| `version` | An `apple_bundle_version` target. Defaults to `"1.0"`. |
| `launch_storyboard` | Override launch storyboard. |

The platform transition to iOS arm64 is handled automatically by `rules_apple`'s `ios_application`.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Tier 2 composable rules</summary>

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl",
    "flutter_ios_engine",
    "flutter_ios_framework_gen",

flutter_ios_engine(name = "my_engine")
flutter_ios_info_plist_gen(name = "my_info_plist", app_name = "My App")

# Frameworks for the app's native assets and `native_deps` dylibs. Omitting
# this from `deps` below builds and renders a perfectly normal-looking app
# that fails every native-asset call at runtime.
flutter_ios_native_frameworks_gen(name = "my_native_frameworks", application = ":my_app")

flutter_ios_runner_lib_gen(
    name = "my_runner",
    registrant = ":my_registrant",
    engine = ":my_engine",
)

ios_application(
    name = "my_ios_app",
    bundle_id = "com.example.myapp",
    families = ["iphone"],
    minimum_os_version = "12.0",
    deps = [":my_framework", ":my_native_frameworks", ":my_runner"],
)
```

</details>

### Android

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_app")

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)

flutter_android_app(
    name = "my_app_android",
    application = ":my_app",
    package_name = "com.example.myapp",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=android .` to generate `android/app/src/main/` with manifest, resources, and Kotlin sources. The macro handles everything automatically — no edits to the `flutter create` output needed.

Add to your `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
bazel_dep(name = "rules_android_ndk", version = "0.1.5")

use_repo(flutter, "flutter_toolchains", "flutter_android_engine_arm64")

# Android NDK CC toolchain (used for native/FFI deps built for Android).
android_ndk_repository_extension = use_extension(
    "@rules_android_ndk//:extension.bzl",
    "android_ndk_repository_extension",
)
use_repo(android_ndk_repository_extension, "androidndk")
register_toolchains("@androidndk//:all")
```

Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to your NDK path (e.g. in `.bazelrc.user`: `build --action_env=ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/ndk`).

Build — no platform flags needed. `flutter_android_bundle` transitions the
Flutter application (AOT compile, FFI deps, and all) to the Android platform
matching its `android_abi`:

```sh
bazel build //:my_app_android
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target (required). |
| `package_name` | Android package name, e.g. `"com.example.myapp"` (required). |
| `app_name` | Display name. Defaults to target name. |
| `android_abi` | Target ABI — `"arm64"` (default) or `"x64"`. Selects the engine and the Android platform the app is built for. |
| `min_sdk_version` | Minimum Android SDK version. |
| `target_sdk_version` | Target Android SDK version. |
| `manifest` | Override AndroidManifest.xml (auto-discovered from `flutter create` output or generated). |
| `multidex` | Multidex mode. Default: `"native"`. |

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Tier 2 composable rules</summary>

For full control over the Android build (custom manifest, custom runner activity, etc.):

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl",
    "flutter_android_bundle",
    "flutter_android_engine",
    "flutter_android_manifest_gen",
    "flutter_android_runner_lib_gen")
load("@rules_android//android:rules.bzl", "android_binary")

flutter_android_bundle(name = "my_bundle", application = ":my_app")
flutter_android_engine(name = "my_engine")
flutter_android_manifest_gen(name = "my_manifest", package_name = "com.example.myapp")

flutter_android_runner_lib_gen(
    name = "my_runner",
    package_name = "com.example.myapp",
    engine = ":my_engine",
)

android_binary(
    name = "my_apk",
    manifest = ":my_manifest",
    multidex = "native",
    deps = [":my_bundle_native_libs", ":my_engine", ":my_runner"],
)
```

`flutter_android_bundle` output groups:

| Group | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `native_libs` | `libapp.so` (AOT) + any `native_deps` shared libraries |
| `flutter_assets` | `flutter_assets/` tree |
| `mobile_install` | JNI-structured symlinks + assets for `bazel mobile-install` |

### Linux

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:linux.bzl", "flutter_linux_app")

    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)

flutter_linux_app(
    name = "my_app_linux",
    application = ":my_app",
    gtk_app_id = "com.example.myapp",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=linux .` to generate `linux/runner/` with C++ sources. If no runner files are found, the built-in template is used automatically.

Cross-compile from macOS (debug/JIT only):

```sh
bazel build //:my_app_linux -c dbg --platforms=@rules_flutter//flutter/platforms:linux_x64
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target (required). |
| `app_name` | Binary name. Defaults to target name. |

### Windows

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:windows.bzl", "flutter_windows_app")

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",

    deps = [":my_lib"],
)

flutter_windows_app(
    name = "my_app_windows",
    application = ":my_app",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=windows .` to generate `windows/runner/` with C++ sources. If no runner files are found, the built-in template is used automatically.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target (required). |
| `app_name` | Binary name. Defaults to target name. |

Output directory structure:

```
my_app/
  my_app.exe             (Win32 runner executable)
  flutter_windows.dll    (Flutter engine)
  app.so                 (AOT-compiled Dart code as ELF)
  data/

### Web

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:web.bzl", "flutter_web_app")

flutter_web_app(
    name = "my_app_web",
    package_name = "my_app",
    deps = ["@deps//:flutter"],
    app_name = "My App",
)
```

**Prerequisites:** Run `flutter create --platforms=web .` to generate `web/` with `index.html`, `manifest.json`, and icons. If these files don't exist, the built-in templates are used automatically.

Add to your `MODULE.bazel`:

```starlark
use_repo(flutter, "flutter_toolchains", "flutter_web_sdk")
```

> **Note:** Unlike other platforms, web rules take `main` + `deps` (Dart source) directly — not a `flutter_application` target. Web compilation uses dart2wasm/dart2js which have a structurally different pipeline from AOT platforms.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `deps` | `dart_library` or `flutter_library` dependencies (required). |
| `main` | The main `.dart` entry point. Default: `"lib/main.dart"`. |
| `app_name` | Application name for HTML title and manifest. Defaults to target name. |
| `pwa` | Generate service worker for offline support. Default: `True`. |

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Tier 2 composable rules</summary>

For full control over compiler/renderer:

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:web.bzl", "flutter_web_bundle")

# WASM (modern, default):
flutter_web_bundle(
    name = "my_app_web",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = ["@deps//:flutter"],

)
```

</details>

## Core Rules

Loaded from `@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl`.

### `flutter_library`

Collects Flutter/Dart sources and assets. Propagates `DartInfo` and `FlutterInfo` providers to downstream targets. Does not compile — serves as the dependency unit for Flutter packages.

```starlark
flutter_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart"]),
    deps = ["@pub_deps//:some_package"],
    assets = glob(["assets/**"]),
    package_name = "my_lib",  # optional, defaults to last component of Bazel package path
)
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `srcs` | Dart source files (mandatory). |
| `deps` | `dart_library` or `flutter_library` dependencies. |
| `assets` | Flutter asset files (images, fonts, etc.). |
| `package_name` | Dart package name. Defaults to the last component of the Bazel package path. |

### `flutter_application`

Core compilation pipeline that chains sources to kernel `.dill`, AOT native code, and asset bundle. Mode-aware: debug (`-c dbg`) produces kernel `.dill` + assets for JIT; release (`-c opt` or default) produces AOT native code + assets.

```starlark
flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart"]),
    deps = [
        ":my_lib",
        "@rules_flutter//flutter:material_icons",  # if app uses Material widgets
    ],
    native_deps = [":my_native_lib"],  # optional, for dart:ffi
)
```

Apps that use Material widgets must list `@rules_flutter//flutter:material_icons` in `deps` to bundle `MaterialIcons-Regular.otf` into `flutter_assets/`. The font is shipped by the active Flutter toolchain; the dep is the explicit opt-in.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `main` | The main `.dart` entry point (mandatory). |
| `package_name` | Dart package name; same value as `pubspec.yaml`'s `name:` (mandatory). Keys the kernel's libraries under stable `package:` URIs (hot-reload parity), anchors codegen sibling co-location, and resolves `package:<self>/...` imports. |
| `srcs` | Additional Dart source files. |
| `deps` | `dart_library` or `flutter_library` dependencies. Add `@rules_flutter//flutter:material_icons` to bundle the MaterialIcons font. |
| `assets` | Asset files to include in the bundle. |
| `native_deps` | Shared libraries for dart:ffi bundling. |
| `defines` | Dart environment defines (`-D` flags). |
| `profile` | If True, compile in profile mode (AOT, unstripped, with service extensions for profiling). Default: `False`. |
| `obfuscate` | If True, obfuscate Dart symbols in the AOT output. Pair with `split_debug_info`. Default: `False`. |
| `split_debug_info` | If True, extract debug info into a separate `.symbols` file. Default: `False`. |
| `extra_gen_snapshot_options` | Additional flags passed directly to `gen_snapshot`. |
| `track_widget_creation` | If True, track widget creation locations for the DevTools inspector. Default: `False`. |
| `shaders` | Fragment shader files (`.frag`) to compile with impellerc. |
| `tree_shake_icons` | If True, tree-shake icon fonts to only include used glyphs. Default: `True`. |
| `license_files` | License/NOTICE files to include in `NOTICES.Z`. |
| `min_os_version` | Minimum OS deployment target for Apple platforms. Passed to `gen_snapshot` as `--macho-min-os-version`. |

#### Dart defines from the command line

Beyond the per-target `defines` attr, the repeatable build flag `--@rules_flutter//flutter:extra_dart_defines=KEY=VALUE` appends defines to every Dart compile (native kernel, `flutter_test`, dart2wasm/dart2js). One define per flag occurrence, so values may contain commas. On a key collision the flag wins over the attr. The keys `dart.vm.profile` and `dart.vm.product` are reserved (the build sets them from the compilation mode) and rejected. The dev tool's `flutter_bazel run --dart-define KEY=VALUE` forwards to this flag and replays the defines on hot reload/restart recompiles, matching `flutter run --dart-define`.

### `flutter_test`

Compiles and runs Flutter widget/unit tests using the Dart VM with Flutter's platform `.dill`. Tests run with assertions enabled.

```starlark
flutter_test(
    name = "my_test",
    main = "my_test.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
)
```

### `flutter_plugin`

Declares a Flutter plugin with Dart API code and per-platform native implementation dependencies.

```starlark
flutter_plugin(
    name = "url_launcher",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart"]),
    deps = ["@pub_deps//:flutter"],

    native_deps = select({

### `flutter_kernel_target`

Compiles Flutter sources to a kernel `.dill` file using Flutter's patched platform kernel. This is the base compilation step shared by all platform targets.

### `flutter_aot_target`

Compiles Flutter sources to an AOT native shared library (`.so` on Linux/Android, `.dylib` on macOS) via `gen_snapshot`.

### `flutter_asset_bundle`

Generates a `flutter_assets/` tree artifact containing `AssetManifest.bin`, `FontManifest.json`, `NOTICES.Z`, and copied asset files.

## Code Generation Rules

Loaded from `@rules_flutter//flutter:codegen.bzl`. These replace `build_runner` with hermetic Bazel actions.

### `dart_codegen`

Per-file code generation. Runs a Dart script or pre-compiled binary as a code generator, producing one output file per input file. Supports persistent Bazel workers to amortize Dart VM startup.

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:codegen.bzl", "dart_codegen")

dart_codegen(
    name = "models_generated",
    srcs = ["lib/model.dart", "lib/order.dart"],
    generator = "tools/my_generator.dart",
    output_suffix = ".g.dart",
    use_worker = True,  # optional, enables persistent worker mode
)
```

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `srcs` | Input `.dart` source files to process (mandatory). |
| `generator` | A `.dart` script to run as the generator. |
| `generator_bin` | A pre-compiled generator executable (alternative to `generator`). |
| `output_suffix` | Suffix for generated files, e.g. `.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`. Default: `.g.dart`. |
| `generator_args` | Additional arguments passed to the generator. |
| `data` | Additional data files the generator needs as inputs. |
| `use_worker` | Enable persistent Bazel worker for `.dart` generators. Default: `False`. |

### `dart_aggregate_codegen`

Package-level code generation. Takes all sources in a package and produces a single aggregate output file.

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:codegen.bzl", "dart_aggregate_codegen")

dart_aggregate_codegen(
    name = "routes",
    srcs = glob(["lib/**/*.dart"]),
    generator_script = "tools/route_generator.dart",
    output = "lib/router.gr.dart",
)
```

## Pub Integration

Use `rules_dart`'s `pub.from_lock()` to resolve pub packages:

```starlark
# In MODULE.bazel:
pub = use_extension("@rules_dart//dart/pub:extensions.bzl", "pub")
pub.from_lock(name = "pub_deps", lock = "//:pubspec.lock")
use_repo(pub, "pub_deps")
```

```starlark
# In BUILD.bazel:
flutter_application(
    name = "app",
    package_name = "app",
    main = "main.dart",
    deps = [
        "@pub_deps//:collection",      # plain Dart package
        ":my_plugin",                   # local Flutter plugin
    ],
)

# For pub packages that are Flutter plugins, wrap them:
flutter_plugin(
    name = "my_plugin",
    deps = ["@pub_deps//:my_plugin"],
    dart_plugin_class = "MyPlugin",
    platforms = ["android", "ios", "macos"],
)
```

See `e2e/plugin_example/` for a complete example.

## Native Interop

Flutter applications can depend on native code built by other Bazel rules. This replaces Flutter's `native_assets` build hook system.

```starlark
cc_shared_library(
    name = "my_native_lib",
    deps = [":my_cc_lib"],
)

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    package_name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = [":my_lib"],
    native_deps = [":my_native_lib"],
)
```

Works with `rules_cc`, `rules_rust`, and any ruleset that produces shared libraries.

## Dev Tool

The `tools/dev_tool/` directory contains `flutter_bazel`, a Dart program that handles the iterative development workflow: device management, app installation, hot reload, and hot restart. It speaks the `--machine` JSON-RPC protocol for IDE compatibility with existing Flutter IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ).

### App output

A running app's console output — `print`, `debugPrint`, `NSLog`, Java stack traces, uncaught errors — is forwarded for the whole life of the run, starting before the VM service comes up so that startup failures are visible.

Where it goes depends on the mode:

| Mode | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| terminal (default) | the app's stdout → the tool's stdout, its stderr → the tool's stderr, matching `flutter run` |
| `--machine` | `app.log` events. Nothing app-related is written to raw stdout, which belongs to the JSON-RPC stream |

With more than one `-d`, terminal output is prefixed `[<device>] ` so an interleaved multi-device run stays readable — same convention as `flutter run -d all`. Machine mode never prefixes: each `app.log` event already carries its `appId`.

Each platform has exactly **one** log source, because a Dart `print()` reaches both the process's stdout and the VM service's `Stdout` stream, and reading both would duplicate every line:

| Platform | Source |
| --- | --- |
| macOS / Linux / Windows | the app process's stdout + stderr |
| Android | `adb logcat`, filtered host-side to `flutter*`, `DartVM`, `AndroidRuntime`, `System.err` and fatal records |
| iOS Simulator | a dedicated `simctl spawn log stream` scoped to the app process (separate from the stream used for VM-service discovery) |
| iOS device | `devicectl --console` |
| Chrome, DDC dev mode | the DWDS VM service's `Stdout`/`Stderr` streams |
| Chrome, WASM / production JS | CDP `Runtime.consoleAPICalled` |
| `attach` | the VM service's `Stdout`/`Stderr` streams — the app wasn't spawned here, so there is no process to read |

**Physical iOS devices.** `devicectl --console` splits its output: its own progress messages go to stdout, the app's console output to stderr. Both are forwarded, and neither channel is treated as an error channel for that reason. This path is exercised by unit tests against a faked devicectl/lldb sequence but is **not covered by an automated test on real hardware**, so treat device-side output as the least-proven of the platforms here.

### Agent / external-tool control surface

`flutter_bazel run` starts an HTTP control channel by default (disable with `--no-http-control-channel`). External tools — IDE integrations, AI coding agents, end-to-end test harnesses — drive the running app over this channel without needing a TTY.

```sh
bazel run @rules_flutter//tools/dev_tool:flutter_bazel -- \
  run --target //:my_app --machine
# stdout emits a JSON line: {"event":"http_control_channel","uri":"http://[::1]:PORT","token":"..."}
# stdout also emits {"event":"app.start","appId":"..."} when the app attaches
```

Once the channel is up:

| Endpoint | Verb | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/command?token=<token>` | `POST` | Run a machine-protocol method against a running session. Body: `{"method":"app.<X>", "params":{"appId":"...", ...}}`. |
| `/sessions/{appId}/screenshot/flutter?token=<token>` | `GET` | PNG of the Flutter widget tree (`_flutter.screenshot` via VM service). |
| `/sessions/{appId}/screenshot/native?token=<token>` | `GET` | PNG of the native window (`screencapture` / `scrot` / `adb screencap` / etc.). |
| `/sessions/{appId}/logs?token=<token>` | `GET` | The app's console output, from a bounded ring buffer. See below. |

**Reading logs.** `/logs` is a cursor-polling endpoint rather than a stream: there is no long-lived connection, and a caller reads exactly as much as it asks for.

| `since` | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| omitted | tail the last 200 lines — what you want with no prior cursor |
| `-N` | tail the last `N` lines |
| `0` | everything still buffered, oldest first |
| `N > 0` | resume at line `N` (feed back a previous `nextCursor`) |

`limit` caps the page (default and maximum 500). A non-numeric `since`, or a non-positive `limit`, is a `400` rather than a silent fallback — a typo'd cursor would otherwise look like a working poll loop that re-reads the tail forever.

```sh
# Tail, then poll forward.
curl -s "$URI/sessions/$APP/logs?token=$T"
# {"lines":[{"i":812,"t":"flutter: meter -18dB","err":false}],
#  "nextCursor":813,"missed":0,"dropped":0,"closed":false}

curl -s "$URI/sessions/$APP/logs?token=$T&since=813"
```

`err` marks lines from an error channel. `missed` is non-zero when the requested cursor had already been evicted, so a poller learns it has a gap instead of reading a short page as though it were complete; `dropped` is the total evicted over the run. `closed` turns true once the app's output source has ended — no further lines can arrive, so a poll loop can stop. The buffer survives the app's exit, so a crashed app's final output is still readable.

App-driving methods (proxied to the agent extensions registered from the generated plugin registrant, which the engine invokes before `main()` on every launch — so they survive hot restart):

`app.dumpWidgetTree`, `app.tap`, `app.longPress`, `app.doubleTap`, `app.drag`,
`app.scrollIntoView`, `app.enterText`, `app.getText`, `app.getRect`,
`app.waitFor`, `app.waitForAbsent`, `app.pageBack`.

Lifecycle methods: `app.hotReload`, `app.restart`, `app.stop`, `daemon.shutdown`.

**Selecting a widget.** Methods that target a widget (`tap`, `longPress`, `doubleTap`, `drag`, `getRect`, `getText`, `scrollIntoView`, `waitFor`, `waitForAbsent`) take **exactly one** selector — mirroring `flutter_driver`'s finder vocabulary:

| param | matches |
| --- | --- |
| `key` | a widget whose `ValueKey` value equals the string |
| `text` | a `Text`/`EditableText` whose content equals the string |
| `tooltip` | a `Tooltip` whose `message` equals the string |
| `type` | a widget whose runtime type name equals the string (e.g. `ElevatedButton`) |
| `semanticsLabel` | a widget whose semantics label equals the string |

Passing zero or more than one selector returns a clear error. Other params: `durationMs` (longPress/drag/scrollIntoView), `dx`/`dy` (drag/scrollIntoView), `scrollableKey` (scrollIntoView, `ValueKey` only), `text` (enterText), `timeoutMs`.

**Settling and timeouts.** After dispatching input, interaction methods wait until the app is idle (no animations in flight) before returning, so a follow-up `getRect`/`getText` sees post-action layout — the same model as `flutter_driver`. The wait is bounded by `timeoutMs` (default 10000); if the app can't settle within it — e.g. the window is minimized/occluded so the embedder has paused vsync — the method returns a `TimeoutException` error rather than blocking forever. The input is still delivered.

**curl note.** The endpoints speak plain HTTP/1.1; no special flags are needed — `curl -s "$URI/..."` works. (If your `curl` is configured to attempt HTTP/2, add `--http1.1`.)

This means an external agent can: build the app, launch it under `flutter_bazel`, drive an entire user flow (taps, text entry, waits, screenshots) over plain HTTP, and shut it down cleanly — no manual `q` keystroke needed.

### Running an iOS example on a physical device

iOS simulator builds need no code signing and run out of the box (e.g.
`flutter_bazel run -t //:hello_world_ios -d ios-simulator`). Device builds need
signing, which is per-developer and must stay out of version control. Each iOS
example therefore ships a `device.example/` template: copy it to a git-ignored
`device/` package, set your bundle id, and generate a provisioning profile the
same way `flutter run` does (Xcode automatic signing). Then:
`flutter_bazel run -t //device:app -d ios`. See the header of any
`e2e/*/device.example/BUILD.bazel.example` for the exact steps.
